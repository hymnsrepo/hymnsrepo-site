**Name of the hymn**
Nearer, My God, to Thee

**Lyrics (optional)**

1. Nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
    E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me,
    still all my song shall be,
    nearer, my God, to thee;
    nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!

2. Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,
    darkness be over me, my rest a stone;
    yet in my dreams I'd be
    nearer, my God, to thee;
    nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
