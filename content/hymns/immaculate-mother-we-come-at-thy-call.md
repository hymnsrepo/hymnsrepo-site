Immaculate Mother, 
We come at thy call, 
And low at thy Altar 
Before thee we fall.

Ave, Ave, Ave Maria!
Ave, Ave Maria!

In grief and temptation,
In joy and in pain,
We'll seek thee, our Mother,
Nor seek thee in vain.

In death's solemn moment,
O Mother, be nigh,
As children of Mary
O teach us to die.
