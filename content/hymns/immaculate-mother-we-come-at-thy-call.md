1. Immaculate Mother, we come at thy call, 
  And low at thy Altar, before thee we fall.

**Ave, Ave, Ave Maria!
Ave, Ave Maria!**

1. In grief and temptation, in joy and in pain,
  We'll seek thee, our Mother, nor seek thee in vain.

1. In death's solemn moment, O Mother, be nigh,
  As children of Mary, O teach us to die.

1. Immaculate Mary, your praises we sing.
    You reign now in splendor with Jesus our King.

**Ave, Ave, Ave Maria!
Ave, Ave Maria!**

2. In heaven the blessed your glory proclaim;
    On earth we your children invoke your fair name.

3. We pray for our Mother, the Church upon earth,
    And bless, Holy Mary, the land of our birth. [Refrain]
