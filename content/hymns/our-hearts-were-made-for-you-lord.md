title: "Our hearts were made for You, Lord"

**Our hearts were made for You, Lord,   
Our hearts were made for You.   
They'll never find, never find, never find rest   
Until they find their rest in You.**

When you call me I will answer,   
When you seek me you will find,   
I will lead you back from exile   
And reveal to you my mind.

I will take you from the nations   
And will bring you to your land.   
From your idos I will cleanse you   
And you'll cherish my command.

I will put my law within you,   
I will write it on your heart;   
I will be your God and Saviour,   
You, my people set apart.
