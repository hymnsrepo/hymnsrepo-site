title: "Bestir Thy power"

**Bestir Thy power and come, Lord,   
To save our sin-laden race,   
Reveal Thy bounty and goodness,   
Diffuse Thy splendour and grace.**

Life your eyes to the hill   
Seek the Saviour until he appears   
It is God who comes to our aid   
God incarnate our ransom has paid.

From the Lord comes release,   
He makes evil to cease all around,   
Night and day He guards us from harm;   
We depend on the strength of His arm.

Come Redeemer and Lord,   
Spread Thy peace and concord on the earth.   
For Thy second coming we yearn;   
From our bondage of sin we will turn.

To our God let us raise   
Our glad voices in praise and esteem,   
Render thanks and bless Him in song   
To Him glory and honour belong.
