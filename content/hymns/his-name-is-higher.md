title: "His name is higher"
---

**His name is higher than any other   
His name is Jesus, His name is Lord**

His name is wonderful, His name is counsellor,   
His name is prince of peace, the Mighty God.

He is the plan of God, He is the mystery,   
In Him we live and move and have our being.

O you of little faith, why do You doubt Him?   
His yoke is easy, His burden light.

In Him is victory, in Him redemption,   
In Him salvation, He sets us free.
