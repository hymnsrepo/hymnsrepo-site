**Whom do you seek? Whom are you looking for?
Whom do you seek? Why do you weep?**

1. I seek the one who brings peace to my people,
   He whole gentleness touches my heart.
   He speaks still in the depths of my being
   How I pray that we never shall part!
1. I seek the one who shows love for all nations
   Heals all suffering, offers us peace.
   He has promised a life without ending,
   Love and laughter and joy will not cease.
1. I am the one who brings peace to all nations,
   I am the one who brings love to you all.
   Come to me and your hearts will be restful
   I have come to bring life to you all.

**I am the One: whom you are looking for!
I am the One: have faith in me!**
