title: "Accept almighty Father"

Accept almighty Father,   
The work of human hands,   
The fruit which eart has given,   
Obedient to your plans.   
They symbolize our hearts, Lord   
So change them by your word   
Into a worthy offering:   
Your Son's own flesh and blood.

We fail to keep Your covenant   
We fail to do our part   
So now we bring this offering   
With humbled contrite heart   
We bring You our thanksgiving   
We come to You with praise   
We ask You for Your blessings   
As now our hearts we raise.
