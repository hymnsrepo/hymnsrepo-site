Blest are You, Lord God of all creation   
Thanks to Your goodness, this bread we offer:   
Fruit of the earth, work of our hands,   
It will become the bread of life.

**Blessed be God, blessed be God,   
Blessed be God, forever. Amen. (x2)**

Blest are you, Lord God of all creation   
Thanks to Your goodness, this wine we offer:   
Fruit of the vine, work of our hands,   
It will become our cup of joy.
