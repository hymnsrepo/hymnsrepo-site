The more we hear of the Word of God,   
The better we will know Him.

**Open our minds and our hearts, O Lord,   
Send us your Spirit anew.   
Open our minds and our hearts, O Father,   
We want to learn more about you.**

The more we hear of the Word of God,   
The better we will love Him.

The more we hear of the Word of God,   
The better we will serve Him.
