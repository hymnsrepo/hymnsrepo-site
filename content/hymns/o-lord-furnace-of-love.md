**O Lord, furnace of love,   
Set our hearts on fire with charity.**

Where there is hatred, let's sow His love.   
Where there is injury, let us show pardon.   
Where there is strife, let us bring His peace.   
Where there is error, truth.

Where there is doubt, let's kindle faith.   
Where there's discouragement, let's bring assurance.   
Where there is sadness, let's awaken joy.   
Where there is darkness, light.
