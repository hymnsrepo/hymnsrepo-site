Blessed are they who are poor in spirit,   
Theirs is the Kingdom of God.   
Bless us, O Lord, make us poor in spirit;   
Bless us, O Lord, our God.   

**We are the light of the world.   
May our light shine before all,   
That they may see the good that we do,   
And give glory to God.**

Blessed are they who are meek and humble,   
They will inherit the earth.   
Bless us, O Lord, make us meek and humble;   
Bless us, O Lord, our God.

Blessed are they who will mourn in sorrow.   
They will be comforted.   
Bless us, O Lord, when we share their sorrow;   
Bless us, O Lord, our God.

Blest those who hunger and thirst for justice.   
They will be satisfied.   
Bless us, O Lord, hear our cry for justice;   
Bless us, O Lord, our God.

Blessed are they who show others mercy,   
They will know mercy too!   
Bless us, O Lord, hear our cry for mercy;   
Bless us, O Lord, our God.

Blessed the hearts that are clean and holy,   
They will behold the Lord!   
Bless us, O Lord, make us pure and holy;   
Bless us, O Lord, our God.

Blessed are they who bring peace among you,   
They are the children of God!   
Bless us, O Lord, may Your peace be with us;   
Bless us, O Lord, our God.

Blest those who suffer from persecution,   
Theirs is the Kingdom of God.   
Bless us O Lord, when they persecute us;   
Bless us, O Lord, our God.
