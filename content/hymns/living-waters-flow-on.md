title: "Living waters flow on"

Living waters flow on   
Sweep away my pain   
Bring your healing to my heart   
Help me love once again.

Cares and worries let me down   
Fear of failure fills my day   
When I'm lost and all alone   
Help me Lord to find my way.

People knocking at my door,   
Strangers seeking love and care   
Never let me turn them down,   
Show me gently how to share.

Children come into my life,   
With their laughter and their song   
When will I become like them?   
Teach me Lord to sing along.
