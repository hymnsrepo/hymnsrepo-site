**Great indeed are Your works, O Lord,   
Now and everymore. (x2)**

The universe, night and day,   
Tells of all Your wonders.   
You are our life and our light:   
We shall praise You always.

You are the path which we tread,   
You will lead us onward.   
From every corner of earth,   
All the nations gather.

You lead us all by the hand   
To Your heavenly kingdom.   
That at the end of all time,   
You will come in glory.
