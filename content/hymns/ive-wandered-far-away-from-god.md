I've wandered far away from God,   
Now I'm coming home;   
The paths of sin too long I've trod,   
Lord I'm coming home.

**Coming home, coming home,   
Never more to roam   
Open are Your arms of love   
Lord I'm coming home.**

I've wasted many precious years,   
Now I'm coming home;   
I now repent with bitter tears,   
Lord I'm coming home.

I'm tired of sin and straying Lord,   
Now I'm coming home;   
I'll trust Your love, believe Your word,   
Lord I'm coming home.

My soul is sick, my heart is sore,   
Now I'm coming home;   
My strength renew, my hope restore,   
Lord I'm coming home.
