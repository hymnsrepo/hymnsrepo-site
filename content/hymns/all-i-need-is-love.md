**All I need is love, all I need is love,
I take no delight in your offering, but in a humble heart.
All I need is love, all I need is love,
All I want is a contrite spirit, all I need is love.**

1. How can you recite my commandments?
   And take my covenant on your lips?
   You who despise my law!
   And throw my words to the winds!
1. You throw your lot with the sinners,
   You're always ready to tell lies.
   Such are your ways, your deeds,
   Should I make no signs and be quiet?
1. What I really want from my people:
   A sincere sacrifice of praise,
   The trust that I come to save,
   A cry to me in their needs.
