title: "I rejoiced when I heard"

**I rejoiced when I heard the people saying:   
Let's go to the temple of the Lord,   
And now at last our feet are standing   
Within your gates, O Jerusalem!**

For the peace of Jerusalem, pray:   
Prosperity to all your dwelling places,   
Let there be peace everywhere within your ramparts,   
Let there be safety within your towers.

For love of my people and my friends,   
This is my prayer: may lasting peace be yours,   
For the sake of the house of the Lord,   
I shall plead and pray for your good.

To the Father almighty sing your praise   
And to the Son, redeemer of the world.   
To the Spirit who dwells in our hearts   
Both now and forever, Amen.

Jerusalem, O fairest city,   
So strongly built as one united whole!   
It is there that the tribes now gather,   
All the tribes to worship the Lord.
