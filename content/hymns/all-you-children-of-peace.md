All you children of peace   
And all you lovers of freedom,   
All you seekers of justice   
All who wait for messiah to come

**_Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice (x2)_   
For He is coming to rule the earth,   
Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice**

All who trust in His love   
All who wait for His righteousness,   
All who've tasted His mercy   
All who hope in His fullness.
