title: "Every morning"

**Every morning when the day's begun,   
I thank the Lord for all He has done   
Every evening I kneel to say:   
Thank You, Lord for another day.**

Thank You for the sun, my Lord,   
Thank You for the moon.   
Thank You for the days and nights,   
Mornings and afternoons.

Thanks for my companions, Lord,   
Who cheer me when I'm low,   
Thanks for those who criticize,   
Who tell me where I'm slow.

Thank You for the work we have,   
The road we journey through   
Even for the pain, my Lord,   
We all must suffer too.
