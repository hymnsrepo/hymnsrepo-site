**At the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow;   
Ev'ry tongue confess Him, king of glory now.**

Though He was truly God, He became a slave,   
And in this emptiness, all our sins did lave.

Obedient unto death, on the cross of pain,   
He was exalted when He rose again.

It is God's holy will, that we call Him Lord   
Who is the First and the Last, and the mighty Word.
