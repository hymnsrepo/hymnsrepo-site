Jesus you're the sweetest name of all,   
Jesus you always hear me when I call,   
Oh Jesus you pick me up each time I fall   
You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.

Jesus how I love to praise your name   
Jesus you're the first the last the same,   
Oh! Jesus you died and took away my shame,   
You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.
