title: "Come into His presence"
---

Come into His presence with thanksgiving in your heart,   
*And give him praise (x2)*   
Come into His presence with thanksgiving in your heart,   
*Your voices raise (x2)*

**Give glory and honour and power unto Him   
Jesus, the name above all names.**

He the Lord is mighty, our Creator we belong to Him,   
We all belong to Him.   
O that all of us today would listen to His voice   
With open minds and with our hearts
