**I now no longer live; Christ, my Lord, lives in me.   
Christ forever my joy, I must walk in His love.**

1. Christ in my mind, my life, my heart.   
*Christ to the world with joy I must bring.*

1. Christ on my right, my left, around.   
*Christ to the world with joy I must bring.*

1. Christ is my way, my peace, my light.   
*Christ to the world with joy I must bring.*

1. Christ my rock, my shield, my strength.   
*Christ to the world with joy I must bring.*

1. Christ is my Lord, my God, my all.   
*Christ to the world with joy I must bring.*
