title: "All to Jesus I surrender"
---

All to Jesus I surrender,  
All to Him I freely give;  
I will ever love and trust Him,  
In His presence daily live.

**I surrender all,  
I surrender all,  
All to thee, my blessed Savior,  
I surrender all.**

All to Jesus I surrender,  
Lord I want to follow Thee;  
Lose my life that I may save it,  
Through thy cross gain victory.

All to Jesus I surrender;  
born of Mary, God's own Son;  
Through this Eucharistic banquet,  
Make me Jesus with Thee one.

All to Jesus I surrender,   
May I see thee in the poor;   
In the fight against oppression,   
Let me never Thee ignore.

All to Jesus I surrender,   
take me to Thy Father's side;   
Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,   
Truly know that He's my guide.
