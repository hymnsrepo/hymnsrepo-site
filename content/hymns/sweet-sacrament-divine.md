Sweet Sacrament divine,   
Hid in thine earthly home;   
Lo! round thy lowly shrine,   
With suppliant hearts we come;   
Jesus, to thee our voice we raise   
In songs of love and heartfelt praise   
Sweet Sacrament divine.

Sweet Sacrament of peace,   
Dear home of every heart,   
Where restless yearnings cease,   
And sorrows all depart.   
There in thine ear, all trustfully,   
We tell our tale of misery,   
Sweet Sacrament of peace.   

Sweet Sacrament of rest,   
Ark from the ocean's roar,   
Within thy shelter blest   
Soon may we reach the shore;   
Save us, for still the tempest raves,   
Save, lest we sink beneath the waves:   
Sweet Sacrament of rest.   

Sweet Sacrament divine,   
Earth's light and jubilee,   
In thy far depths doth shine   
The Godhead's majesty;   
Sweet light, so shine on us, we pray   
That earthly joys may fade away:   
Sweet Sacrament divine.
