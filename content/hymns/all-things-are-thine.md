**All things are thine, O Lord:
We offer Thee what we receive from They hand.**

1. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Israel's God, for all ages.
  Thine is the power and glory and splendour.
1. Thou art the ruler, Lord, over the earth and the heavens,
  Only thy hand gives greatness and strengthens.
1. Therefore, this day, O Lord, praises and thanks do we give thee;
  Thy name be blessed for ever and ever.
