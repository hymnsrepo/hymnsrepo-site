A tender shoot has started up   
From a root of grace,   
As ancient seers imparted   
From Jesse’s holy race;   
It blooms without a blight,   
Blooms in the cold bleak winter,   
Turning our darkness into light.

This shoot, Isaiah taught us,   
From Jesse’s root should spring;   
The Virgin Mary brought us   
The branch of which we sing:   
Our God of endless might   
Gave her this child to save us,   
Thus turning darkness into light.
