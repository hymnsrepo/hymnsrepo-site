Angels we have heard on high   
Sweetly singing o'er the plains,   
And the mountains in reply   
Echoing their joyous strains

**Gloria, in excelsis Deo!   
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!**

Come to Bethlehem and see   
Christ whose birth the angels sing;   
Come, adore on bended knee,   
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

See Him in a manger laid,   
Whom the choirs of angels praise;   
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,   
While our hearts in love we raise.
