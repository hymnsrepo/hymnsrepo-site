**From the depths I call to You, O Lord,   
Listen to my cry**

Lord, in compassion, listen to my pleading,   
Listen to my cry,   
If You refuse, Lord, to forgive your people's sins,   
We shall surely die.

So I am waiting, waiting for Him patiently,   
Hoping in His word,   
More than the watchman waiting for the dawn to come   
I await the Lord.

So let us trust him, for in Him is mercy;   
He the Lord, is kind.   
He gives us pardon, generous redemption,   
Casts our sins behind.
