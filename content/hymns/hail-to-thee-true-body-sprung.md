Hail to thee, true body sprung   
From the Virgin Mary's womb!   
Same that on the cross was hung   
Bore for man the bitter doom.   
Sweet Jesus, Mary's Son.

Thou, whose side was pierced and flowed   
Both with water and with blood;   
Suffer us to taste of thee,   
In our life's last agony.   
Sweet Jesus, Mary's Son.
