**Yes, I shall arise and return to my Father,
I will say: I have sinned, I have sinned.**

1. Father, against you alone have I sinned.
  How can I ever be called your child?
  Treat me as one of your servants, O Lord.
  Accept me as a slave.
1. Thank you, my Father, for giving me light,
  Courage and strength to return to you.
  Give me again, Lord, the joy of your help.
  And make me walk aright.
1. Praise to you, Father: you've shown me your love.
  Love that has raised me from death to life,
  Filling my heart with the Spirit of Christ
  To be your child once more.
