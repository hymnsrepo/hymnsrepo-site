title: "We see the troubles in our lives"
---

We see the troubles in our lives,   
We wonder why things are this way   
Why is there pain? Why is there loneliness?   
Is there one who can help us in our need?

**Look up to the Lord, put your hope in the Saviour   
He showed us that to live we first must die.   
Look up to the Lord, put your hope in the Saviour,   
The darkness of his death has turned to light!**

Life can be difficult at times,   
The answers may seem far away:   
Why is there hate? Why is there selfishness?   
Is there one who overcame this strife?

We feel the closed world of the mind,   
We look for words from those who care.   
Where are the just? Where is the openness?   
Is there one whose life made others free?
