Be still for the presence of the Lord, the Holy One is near.   
Come bow before him now, with reverence and fear.   
In Him no sin is found, we stand on Holy ground.   
Be still for the presence of the Lord, the Holy One is near.

Be still for the glory of the Lord, is shining all around;   
He burns with holy fire, with splendour He is crowned.   
How awesome is the sight, our radiant King of light!   
Be still for the presence of the Lord, the Holy One is near.

Be still for the power of the Lord, is moving in this place   
He comes to cleanse and heal, to minister His grace.   
No work too hard for Him, in faith receive from Him.   
Be still for the power of the Lord, is moving in this place
