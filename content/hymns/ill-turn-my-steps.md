**I'll turn my steps to the altar of God,   
I'll turn my steps to the gladness of my life.**

1. Show Your justice in pleading my cause,   
Let me walk in the way of Your love.

1. Lead me on with Your power and strength   
And my courage will never be spent.

1. Fill my heart with Your truth and Your light   
As I enter with joy in Your sight.

1. Holy praises to God I will sing.   
I will trust and will hope in my King.

1. Glory be to the Father and Son   
And the Spirit while ages are run.
