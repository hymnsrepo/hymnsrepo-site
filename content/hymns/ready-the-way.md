**Ready the way, ready the way,  
ready the way of the Lord.  
Ready the way, ready the way,  
ready the way of the Lord.**

Make straight the road,  
raise the valleys, and mountains make low.  
Turning from sin, let the broken be whole,  
and ready the way of the Lord.  

As we wait for you,  
give us the strength to walk in your truth,  
so we may love more like you  
and ready the way for you, Lord.

Let us see your face;  
in our hearts we prepare a place.  
Come bring this world  
your mercy and grace,  
as we ready the way for you, Lord.
