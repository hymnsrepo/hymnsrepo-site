Jesus! my Lord, my God my all!   
How can I love Thee as I ought?   
And how revere this wondrous gift,   
So far surpassing hope or thought?

**Sweet Sacrament we Thee adore**   
***O make us love Thee more and more (x2)***

Had I but Mary's sinless heart   
To love Thee with my dearest King,   
Oh with what bursts of fervent praise   
Thy goodness, Jesus, would I sing!

Ah, see! within a creature's hand   
The vast Creator deigns to be,   
Reposing infant-like as though
On Joseph's arm or Mary's knee.
