At the cross her station keeping,  
Stood the mournful Mother weeping,  
Close to Jesus to the last.

Through her heart, His sorrow sharing,   
All His bitter anguish bearing,  
Now at length the sword had pass'd.  

Oh, how sad and sore distress'd  
Was that Mother highly blest  
Of the sole-begotten One!

Christ above in torment hangs;  
She beneath beholds the pangs  
Of her dying glorious Son.

Is there one who would not weep,   
Whelm'd in miseries so deep  
Christ's dear Mother to behold?

Can the human heart refrain  
From partaking in her pain,  
In that Mother's pain untold?  

Bruis'd, derided, curs'd, defil'd,   
She beheld her tender child  
All with bloody scourges rent.

For the sins of His own nation,  
Saw Him hang in desolation,  
Till His spirit forth He sent.

O thou Mother! fount of love!  
Touch my spirit from above;  
Make my heart with thine accord.

Make me feel as thou hast felt;  
Make my soul to glow and melt  
With the love of Christ our Lord.

Holy Mother! pierce me through;  
In my heart each wound renew  
Of my Saviour crucified.

Let me share with thee His pain,   
Who for all my sins was slain,  
Who for me in torments died.

Let me mingle tears with thee,  
Mourning Him who mourn'd for me,  
All the days that I may live.

By the cross with thee to stay,  
There with thee to weep and pray,  
Is all I ask of thee to give.

Virgin of all virgins best,  
Listen to my fond request  
Let me share thy grief divine.

Let me, to my latest breath,  
In my body bear the death  
Of that dying Son of thine.

Wounded with His every wound,  
Steep my soul till it hath swoon'd  
In His very blood away.

Be to me, O Virgin, nigh,  
Lest in flames I burn and die,  
In His awful Judgment day.

Christ, when Thou shalt call me hence,  
Be Thy Mother my defence,  
Be Thy cross my victory.

While my body here decays,  
May my soul Thy goodness praise,  
Safe in Paradise with Thee.
