Longing for light, we wait in darkness.   
Longing for truth, we turn to You.   
Make us your own, Your holy people,   
Light for the world to see.

**Christ be our light   
Shine in our hearts   
Shine through the darkness   
Christ be our light   
Shine in Your church gathered today.**

Longing for peace, our world is troubled   
Longing for hope many despair   
Your Word alone has pow'r to save us   
Make us your living voice.

Longing for food, many our hungry   
Longing for water, many still thirst   
Make us your bread, broken for others   
Shared until all are fed.

Longing for shelter, many are homeless   
Longing for warmth, many are cold   
Make us your building, sheltering others,   
Walls made of living stone.

Many the gifts, many the people   
Many the hearts, that yearn to belong   
Let us be servants to one another,   
Making Your kingdom come.
