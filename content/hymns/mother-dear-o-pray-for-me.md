title: "Mother dear O pray for me"

Mother dear, O pray for me!   
Whilst far from heav'n and thee.   
I wander in a fragile bark,   
O'er life's tempestuous sea.   
O Virgin Mother, from thy throne,   
So bright in bliss above.   
Protect thy child and cheer my path   
With thy sweet smile of love.

**Mother dear, remember me!   
And never cease thy care,   
'Till in heaven eternally,   
Thy love and bliss I share.**

Mother dear, O pray for me!   
Should pleasure's siren lay.   
E'er tempt thy child to wander far   
From Virtue's path away.   
When thorns beset life's devious way,   
And darkling waters flow.   
Then Mary aid thy weeping child,   
Thyself a mother show.
