1. When the sun has set and the night is on,
  When the darkness falls and the light has gone,
  You be my light, O Lord, and lead me on.
  You be my light, O Lord, and lead me on.
1. When I'm growing weak and my steps are slow
  When the hopes are bleak and I've strength no more,
  You be my strength, O Lord, and lead me on.
  You be my strength, O Lord, and lead me on.
1. When my eyes grow dim and I cannot see,
  When a chance is slim of a friend for me,
  You be my friend, O Lord, and lead me on.
  You be my friend, O Lord, and lead me on.
1. When I cannot talk for there's no one here,
  And I cannot walk though the end is near,
  You be my rest, O Lord, and lead me on.
  You be my rest, O Lord, and lead me on.
