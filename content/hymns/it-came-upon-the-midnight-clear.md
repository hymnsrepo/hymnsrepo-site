1. It came upon the midnight clear,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That glorious song of old,   
From angels bending near the earth   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To touch their harps of gold;   
"Peace on the earth, good will to men   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From heaven’s all-gracious King" –    
The world in solemn stillness lay   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear the angels sing.

2. Still through the cloven skies they come      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With peaceful wings unfurled,   
And still their heavenly music floats   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O'er all the weary world;   
Above its sad and lowly plains   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They bend on hovering wing,   
And ever o'er its Babel-sounds   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blessed angels sing.

3. But with the woes of sin and strife   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world has suffered long;   
Beneath the angel-strain have rolled   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two thousand years of wrong;   
And man, at war with man, hears not   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The love song which they bring; –   
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hear the angels sing!

4. And ye, beneath life's crushing load,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose forms are bending low,   
Who toil along the climbing way   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With painful steps and slow,   
Look now! for glad and golden hours   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come swiftly on the wing; –   
Oh, rest beside the weary road   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hear the angels sing!

5. For lo! the days are hastening on   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By prophet bards foretold,   
When, with the ever circling years   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall come the age of gold;   
When Peace shall over all the earth,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its ancient splendors fling,   
And the whole world give back the song,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which now the angels sing.
