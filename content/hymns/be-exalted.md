**Be exalted, O God above the heavens,   
Let your glory be over all the earth (x2)**

I will give thanks to You,   
O Lord, among the people   
I will sing praises to You among the nations,   
For Your steadfast love is great,   
Is great to the heavens,   
And Your faithfulness, your faithfulness   
To the clouds.

It is good to thank You, Lord   
And to praise Your name with music,   
To proclaim Your love and mercy in the morning.   
For your deeds have made me glad,   
At Your works I shout in triumph,   
Lord, how wonderful and how marvellus   
Are your designs!

All your creatures thank You, Lord,   
And Your friends repeat their blessing,   
Age to age proclaim Your splendour and Your glory   
You are kind to us, O God,   
Full of tender love and mercy,   
And Your graciousness and Your constancy   
Have no compare.
