**How I rejoiced when I heard them say -    
"Let's go up to God's house today"   
Here we are in Jerusalem:   
City of the living God.**

Enter His courts with songs of praise,   
Enter His gates with thanks.   
He is the Lord, He is our God,   
Honour and bless His name.

Come let us worship and bend low   
Into His presence come!   
We are His sheep, marked with His seal,   
Faithful His love endures.

O that today we hear Him call   
O that our eyes perceive   
And may His touch warm up our hearts   
O that we taste and see.
