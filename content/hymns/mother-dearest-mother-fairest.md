Mother dearest, Mother fairest,   
Help of all, who call on thee.   
Virgin purest, brightest, rarest,   
Help us, help, we cry to thee.

**Mary, help us, help we pray.   
Mary, help us, help we pray.   
Help us in all care and sorrow.   
Mary, help us, help we pray.**

Lady, help in pain and sorrow,   
Soothe those rack'd on beds of pain,   
May the golden light of morrow,   
Bring them health and joy again. 

Lady, help the absent loved ones.   
How we miss their presence here.   
May the hand of Thy protection   
Guide and guard them far and near.
