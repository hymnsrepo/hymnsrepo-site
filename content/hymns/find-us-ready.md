**Find us ready, Lord, not standing still.  
Find us working and loving and doing your will.  
Find us ready, Lord, faithful in love,  
building the kingdom that’s here and above,  
building the kingdom of mercy and love.**

We must wait for the Lord  
for we know not the time.  
So here and today  
we gather and pray,  
discovering love in our midst.  

We must make straight the path,  
God’s love revealed.  
With sin cast aside,  
God’s mercy alive,  
fear not for here is your God.  

Lifting up those bowed down,  
we prepare for our God.  
Rejoice in the Lord,  
for hope has been born  
in hearts where our God finds a home.

*Optional final ending*   
Brick by brick, stone by stone,  
find us working and loving and doing your will.  
Find us ready, Lord, faithful in love,  
building the kingdom that’s here and above.
