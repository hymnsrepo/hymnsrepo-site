Love laid in a lowly manger:  
Love has come to save.  
Love a child and a redeemer:  
Jesus born this day.  

Word made flesh and gently sleeping:  
Peace for all on earth.  
Faith fulﬁlled and vict'ry promised:  
Hope for a humble birth.  
Come, O come, adore Jesus Christ, the Lord.  

**Holy, holy, Glory to God on high.  
Holy, holy, Love has captured the night.**

Loving Father, faithful Maker,  
At creation's light  
Chose the child and Virgin Mother:  
Hope for all this night.  
Come, O come, adore Jesus Christ, the Lord.

Angels, shepherds, earthly father,  
Wise men from the East,  
A holy Mother sweetly singing  
To the Prince of Peace.  
Come, O come and see Jesus Christ, the King.
