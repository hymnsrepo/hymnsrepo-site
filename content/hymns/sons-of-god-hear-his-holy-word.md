**Sons of God, hear His holy Word   
Gather round the table of the Lord   
Eat His Body, drink His Blood   
And we'll sing a song of love   
Allelu, allelu, allelu, alleluia**

1. Brothers, sister we are one,   
And our life has just begun,   
In the spirit we are young,   
We can live forever. 

1. Shout together to the Lord   
Who has promised our reward,   
Happiness a hundred fold   
And we'll live forever.   

1. Jesus gave a new command:   
That we love our fellow man,   
Till we reach the promised land   
Where we'll live forever.   

1. If we want to live with Him,   
We must also die with Him,   
Die to selfishness and sin   
And we'll live forever. 

1. Make the world a unity,   
Make all men one family,   
Till we meet The Trinity   
And we'll live forever. 

1. With the church we celebrate,   
Jesus coming we await,   
So we'll make a holiday,   
So we'll live forever.
