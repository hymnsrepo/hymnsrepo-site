**Take thou the offering thy children make,
all united for Thy name's sake.**

1. Heavenly Father, almighty God.
  We offer Thee this sacrifice.
  Show to us thy mercy, O Lord.
  Forgive us the sins of all our life.
1. To thee, O Lord, our joy we give,
  Our weariness, our work and woe,
  The anxious moments that we live;
  Lighten our burden as we go.
1. For all the living take Thou this gift,
  For our brothers and sisters who join in prayer,
  For the absent ones our hearts we lift,
  Keep them all in They loving care.
