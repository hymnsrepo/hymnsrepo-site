title: "Do this in memory of me"
---

I am the bread of life   
All who believe in me will have eternal life   
I am the bread of life   
Come down from heaven so that all who eat this bread   
Will never die

**Take the living bread of life   
Take the cup of sacrifice   
Do this in memory of me   
Take the body and the blood   
Given freely out of love   
_Do this in memory of me (x2)_**

I am the bread of life   
Whoever comes to me will not hunger again   
I am the bread of life   
No one can come to me unless the Father calls them   
unto Him

_Amen I say to you unless you eat the flesh   
of the Son of Man and drink His blood   
you shall not have life  
All who will eat my flesh and drink   
my blood will have eternal life   
And I will raise them up again_
