Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning   
Give me oil in my lamp, I pray   
Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning   
Keep me burning till the break of day.

**Sing hosanna, sing hosanna,   
Sing hosanna to the King of Kings!   
Sing hosanna, sing hosanna,   
Sing hosanna to the King.**

Give me joy in my heart, keep me praising   
Give me joy in my heart, I pray   
Give me joy in my heart, keep me praising   
Keep me praising till the break of day.

Give me love in my work, keep me serving   
Give me love in my work, I pray   
Give me love in my work, keep me serving   
Keep me serving till the break of day.

Give me peace in my mind, keep me resting   
Give me peace in my mind, I pray   
Give me peace in my mind, keep me resting   
Keep me resting till the break of day.
