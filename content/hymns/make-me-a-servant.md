**Make me a servant, humble and meek.   
Lord, let me lift up those who are weak,   
And may the prayer of my heart always be:   
_Make me a servant (x2)_   
Make me a servant today!**

Even though You were in the form of God,   
You took the form of a slave.   
You accepted death even on a cross,   
So God exalted Your name.

Ere You formed me in my mother's womb,   
You called me by my name.   
And you touched my mouth and appointed me   
A prophet to the world

May I heal the sick and the crippled bind,   
Bring back the sheep that stray.   
May I seek the lost and the weak made strong,   
With justice feed the poor.
