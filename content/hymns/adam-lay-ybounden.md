Adam lay ybounden,   
   Bounden in a bond;   
Four thousand winter   
   Thought he not too long.   
   
And all was for an apple,   
   An apple that he took,   
As clerkÃ«s finden written   
   In their book.   
   
Nor had one apple taken been,   
   The apple taken been,   
Then had never Our Lady   
  A-been heaven's queen.
  
Blessed be the time   
   That apple taken was.   
Therefore we may singen   
   _Deo gratias!_
