title: "Bind us together"
---

**Bind us together, Lord, bind us together   
With cords that cannot be broken.   
Bind us together, Lord, bind us together   
Bind us together with love.**

There is only one God, there is only one King,   
There is only one Body, that is why we sing.

Though there are many branches, there is only one vine,   
We are one in Christ Jesus, that is why we sing.

One with Christ in His death that, as One, we might rise.   
So we are but one people, that is why we sing.

There is only one table, Christ alone is our host.   
He invites us together, that is why we sing.
