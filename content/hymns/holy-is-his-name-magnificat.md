subtitle: The Magnificat | John Michael Talbot

1. My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,   
  And my spirit exults in God my Saviour.   
  For He has looked with mercy on my lowliness,   
  And my name will be forever exalted.   
  For the mighty God has done great things for me,   
  and His mercy will reach from age to age.   
  **And holy, holy, holy is His name.**

2. He has mercy in every generation,   
  He has revealed His power and His glory.   
  He has cast down the mighty in their arrogance,   
  and has lifted up the meek and the lowly.   
  He has come to help His servant Israel;   
  He remembers His promise to our fathers.   
  **And holy, holy, holy is His name.**

3. I sing with all my heart, my spirit leaps for joy.   
  Who am I that You should honour me?   
  By Your saving grace, all will call me blest,   
  and proclaim the greatness of Your name!   
  **Magnificat, magnificat anima mea Dominum.   
  Magnificat, magnificat anima mea Dominum.   
  And holy, holy, holy is His name.**

4. How great Your gifts to us, how wonderful Your works,   
  With your pow'r You strengthen all the weak.      
  Your mercy will endure; steadfast is Your love.   
  All the faithful follow and believe.   
  **Magnificat, magnificat anima mea Dominum.   
  Magnificat, magnificat anima mea Dominum.   
  And holy, holy, holy is His name.**

5. You scatter all the proud, the rich You send away,   
  All the mighty vanish in Your sight.      
  You fill each hungry heart, raising up the least.   
  You are hope to all who are in need.   
  **Magnificat, magnificat anima mea Dominum.   
  Magnificat, magnificat anima mea Dominum.   
  And holy, holy, holy is His name.**

5. You rescue all the poor, Your servant Israel,   
  You preserve the promise long foretold.      
  You keep Your saving word, faithful is Your name.   
  Every generation sings Your praise.   
  **Magnificat, magnificat anima mea Dominum.   
  Magnificat, magnificat anima mea Dominum.   
  And holy, holy, holy is His name.**
