When she heard the voice of God   
calling her to be  
the instrument he needed   
to bring our world the King of Kings,  
she could not understand  
the wisdom of God's plan, but still she answered:  
"Let it be. Let it be done unto me."  

When he heard the voice of God  
calling him to stand  
and take the virgin as his wife   
and teach her child to be a man,  
he could not understand  
the wisdom of God's plan, but still he answered:  
"Let it be. Let it be done unto me."

**And we say: "Yes, Lord,  
we're ready to receive.  
Yes, Lord, we're ready to believe.   
Let it be. Let it be done unto me."**

When we hear the voice of God  
calling out our names,  
Lord, we pray you give us faith   
to answer you in anything.  
And we may not understand  
the wisdom of your plan, but we will answer:  
"Let it be. Let it be done unto me."
