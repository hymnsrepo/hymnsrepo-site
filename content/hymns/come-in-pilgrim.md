title: "Come in pilgrim"
---

**Come in pilgrim, lay your burden down   
We're all comrades as we travel on the way.   
We share a common gift, our covenant in Christ,   
And we're going to celebrate His love today,   
We will sing and celebrate His love today.**

When we come to join in prayer,   
Let us first confess   
We have looked too much to ourselves   
And loved each other less.

Hear the Word proclaimed with power   
To search the hearts of all.   
We shall make its meaning new   
By responding to its call.

We are one with Christ our Lord   
As he offers His Father praise   
We bring gifts: our lives and love,   
Seeking God's will each day.
