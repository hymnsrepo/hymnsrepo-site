title: "Come back to me"
---

Come back to me with all your heart   
Don't let fear keep us apart.   
Trees do bend, though straight and tall   
So must we to others' call.

**Long have I waited for your coming home to me   
And living deeply our new life**

The wilderness will lead you   
To your heart where I will speak   
Integrity and justice   
With tenderness you shall know.

You shall sleep secure with peace   
Faithfullness will be your joy.
