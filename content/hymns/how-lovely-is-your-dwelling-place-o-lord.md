title: "How lovely is Your dwelling place, O Lord!"

**How lovely is Your dwelling place, O Lord!   
What peace and joy to feel so close to You!   
Our heart and soul ring out their joy this morning / evening,   
We long to meet You, God, the living God.**

The sparrow even here has found a shelter,   
The shallow by Your altars builds a nest.   
O happy those whose dwelling is Your temple,   
Who day by day Your praises sing, O Lord.

One day within Your courts indeed is better   
Than thousand days elsewhere afar from You.   
To wait upon the threshold of Your temple   
Is better than to waste our life in vain.

O Lord, You are our strength and our protection.   
Your favour and Your glory, grant us now.   
Refuse not any good to those who love You,   
The people that is Yours for evermore.
