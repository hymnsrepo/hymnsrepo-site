*O cross erected above the world   
Cross of our Saviour King (x2)*   
Fount from which gushed the waters,   
Straight from the wound in His side,   
Filling our lives with His gift of grace,   
Cross of our Saviour King.

*O cross sublime and refulgent tree,   
Cross of our Saviour King (x2)*   
Jesus Thru' thee has saved us,   
Great was the price that He paid,   
Thou art the folly of love divine,   
Cross of our Saviour king.

*O cross thou channel of grace divine,   
Cross of our Saviour King (x2)*   
Tree on which death was conquered,   
Thou the first altar of love,   
Jesus the Lamb gave His life on thee   
Cross of our Saviour King.

*O cross all honour and praise to thee,   
Cross of our Saviour King (x2)*   
Thou art the sign of victory,   
Sign of redemption and life,   
Homage and glory belong to thee,   
Cross of our Saviour King.
