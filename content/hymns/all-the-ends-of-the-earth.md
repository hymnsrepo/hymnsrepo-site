title: "All the ends of the earth"

**All the ends of the earth,   
all you creatures of the sea,   
Lift up your eyes to the wonders of the Lord.   
For the Lord of the earth,   
The master of the sea,   
Has come with justice for the world**

Break into song at the deeds of the Lord.   
The wonders He has done in every age.

Heaven and earth shall rejoice in His might,   
Every heart, every nation call Him Lord.

The Lord has made His salvation known,   
Faithful to His promises of old.

Let the ends of the earth, let the sea and all it holds,   
Make music before our King!
