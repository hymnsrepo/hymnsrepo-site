title: "Listen to Your people"
---

Listen to Your people, linked now hand in hand.   
Gathered at Your table, secure in love we stand.   
As seekers of Your kingdom, we unite to pray:   
Jesus, Saviour, guide us, for You are the Way.

Many tongues we speak, Lord, in our ancient land   
Yet with hearts united and joined in love's demand.   
O Christ, our hope in darkness, calling age and youth:   
Jesus be our Teacher, for You are the Truth.

Bring Your Church renewal through this century,   
Give us lasting peace, Lord, and inner liberty.   
O see our world so weary, torn by endless strife:   
Jesus be our Healer, for You are the Life.
