As the deer that pants for water so my soul longs after You  
You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship You.

**You alone are my strength, my shield  
To you alone does my spirit yield.  
You alone are my heart's desire  
and I long to worship You.**

I want you more than gold or silver, only You can satisfy  
You alone are the true joy giver and the apple of my eye.

You're my friend and You are my brother even though You are my King  
I love you more than any other and much more than anything.
