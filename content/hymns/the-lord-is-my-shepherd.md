title: "The Lord is my shepherd"
---

The Lord is my shepherd, there is nothing I shall want.   
Fresh and green are the pastures where He gives me repose.   
Near restful waters He leads me to revive my drooping spirit.

**The Lord is my shepherd, there is nothing I shall want.   
Yes, the Lord is my shepherd, there is nothing I shall want.**

He guides me along what He knows to be right.   
If I walk in the darkness, no evil would I fear.   
I know that He will be there, with His crook and with His staff.

The Lord has prepared, such a banquet for me.   
Surely goodness and kindness shall follow after me.   
In the Lord's own house shall I dwell all the days of my life.
