Come, Thou long-expected Jesus  
Born to set Thy people free  
From our fears and sins release us  
Let us find our rest in Thee  
Israel's strength and consolation  
Hope of all the earth Thou art  
Dear Desire of every nation  
Joy of every longing heart  

Joy to those who long to see thee  
Day-spring from on high appear  
Come thou promised Rod of Jesse  
Of Thy birth we long to hear  
O'er the hills the angels singing  
News glad tidings of a birth  
Go to him your praises bringing  
Christ the Lord has come to earth

Come to earth to taste our sadness  
He whose glorie-s knew no end  
By his life he brings us gladness  
Our Redeemer Shepherd Friend  
Leaving riches without number  
Born within a cattle stall  
This the everlasting wonder  
Christ was born Lord of all

Born Thy people to deliver  
Born a child and yet a King  
Born to reign in us forever  
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring  
By Thine own eternal Spirit  
Rule in all our hearts alone  
By Thine all sufficient merit  
Raise us to Thy glorious throne
