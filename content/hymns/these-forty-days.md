title: "These forty days"
---

These forty days O Lord we spend   
In fast and prayer with You;   
Correct our faults and curb our pride,   
Our minds and heart renew.

**This time of grace employ,   
Prepare your hearts with joy,   
To celebrate the Paschal feast.**

Our Lenten gift we bring to you:   
A humbled contrite heart   
O teach us in this world to live   
As people set apart.

May we each day deny ourselves   
To raise our minds to you;   
And show to those who are in need,   
Your goodness and your love.

You help us grow in holiness   
And from our sins to rise.   
Lord, through Your passion and Your death,   
May Easter be our prize.
