title: "At this time of giving"

**At this time of giving gladly now we bring   
Gifts that have been given by our God and King.**

Here is our bread of pain, work of human hands   
This is the bread of joy, we will share in love.

See, Lord, this joyous wine harvested from earth,   
This is our wine of love, ready for the feast.
