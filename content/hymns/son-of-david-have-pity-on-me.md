**Son of David, have pity on me,
Son of God, hear my plea.
O Son of David, have pity on me,
Listen to my plea!**

1. Those who sow in tears and pain,
   Will return rejoicing.
   The lamb will leap, the lion lie down,
   On your day, O Lord.
2. He has borne our grief and pain.
   Burdened down with sorrow.
   Who'd believe what we have seen?
   Like a lamb He is slain.
3. By his word this world was made,
   Every grain and flower.
   The poor stand near to God, the Lord!
   Those who seek his face.
