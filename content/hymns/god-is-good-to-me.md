title: "God is good to me"
---

God is good to me! O what love I see!   
Jesus as a lamb was slain.   
He delivered me, cleansed and set me free;   
Lord of all, He rose again!

**Now I live, yet not I!   
Jesus is alive in me!   
Sending the Spirit's flame into my heart again,   
God has poured His love on me!**

God has shown His love, sent His only Son:   
Jesus Christ to save the world.   
Life eternal through His death He brought.   
Yes, believe that God is love!

God is perfect Love, one who lives in love   
Lives in God and God in Him.   
Yes, I feel His love; fear gives way to peace,   
'cause I know He loved me first.
