Scattered and broken, bent in our way,  
we are your people gathered to praise you.  
A vineyard uprooted, narrow in sight.  
Come, Lord of Glory! Come, Lord of Light!

*Refrain (Advent)*   
**Come to us, O Lord of Glory and shine in our hearts.  
Come to us, O Lord of Glory and make us anew.  
Lord, we wait for you. Lord, we wait for you.  
Lord, we wait for you. Come, Lord of Glory.**

*Refrain (Christmas)*   
**Come to us, O Child of glory, be born in our hearts.  
Come to us, O Child of glory and make us anew.  
We adore you, we adore you,  
We adore you, sweet child of glory.**

Come, Lord, our dayspring, come from on high,   
as we your people gather to praise you.  
Unworthy to taste from your heavenly vine,   
but your word will heal us. Come, Light Divine!

Come, Root of Jesse; come, Davidâ€™s son;  
come, Star of Morning; we come to praise you.  
Hope of creation, of all humankind,  
reign over body, spirit and mind.
