O maiden will you be the mother of the Saviour?   
Your God has chosen you, to give the world His Son   
His power will be your shield, His Spirit come upon you   
And Mary bowed and said: God's will be done.

**And Mary said yes (x3)   
When she knew that it was the will of God**

No cradle will be His, but just a simple manger,   
A helpless little babe from Herod's wrath He'll run   
And in a foreign land, long years He'll have to linger   
And Mary bowed and said: God's will be done.

And soon the day will come, when enemies will round Him   
And nail Him to a tree, your sinless spotless one   
The price of mankind's ransom will heavy fall upon Him   
And Mary bowed and said: God's will be done.
