title: "Ave Maria (As I kneel)"
---

As I kneel before you,  
As I bow my head in prayer,  
Take this day, make it yours  
And fill me with your love.

**Ave Maria, Gratia plena,  
Dominus tecum, Benedicta tu.**  

All I have I give you,  
Every dream and wish are yours,  
Mother of Christ, Mother of mine,  
Present them to my Lord.

As I kneel before you,  
And I see your smiling face,  
Ev'ry thought, ev'ry word  
Is lost in your embrace.
