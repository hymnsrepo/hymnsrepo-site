**Lord make me like You   
Please, make me like You   
You are a servant, make me one too.   
O Lord won't You give me Your strength everyday   
To build a community, to follow Your way.**

Whoever among you desires to be great,   
Must be the servant of all.   
For even the Son of Man came to serve   
And give His life for the world.

You call me your master and Lord so I am   
See, I have washed your feet   
To set and example for all of you   
Of service and of love.

The Spirit anoints me and calls me by name   
To bring good news to the poor,   
Release to the captives and sight to the blind,   
To set the prisoners free.
