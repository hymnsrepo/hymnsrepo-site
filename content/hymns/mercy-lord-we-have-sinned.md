**Mercy, Lord, we have sinned, listen to our plea,
Mercy, Lord, we have sinned, answer now our prayer.**

1. We have turned from the poor, let the hungry die,
  We neglect the oppressed, we ignore their cry.
  Now's the time, now's the day,
    turn back to your God,
  Tear your hearts, cry to Him:
    Spare your people, Lord!
1. We confess, we detest our disunity.
  We have lived for ourselves, failed in charity.
  Banish, Lord, from our hearts bitterness and pain.
  Cleanse us, Lord, heal our lives with your Spirit's flame.
