**Ring out your joy give glory to God   
Lift up your hearts and sing   
Let all creation tell of his name;   
Praise him for evermore.**

1. Blessed are you God of our fathers   
   _Glory and praise for evermore_   
   Blessed your great and glorious holy name   
   _Glory and praise for evermore_.

2. Blest in the temple of your glory   
   _Glory and praise for evermore_   
   Blessed are your who gaze into the depths   
   _Glory and praise for evermore_.
