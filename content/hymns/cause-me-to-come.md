title: "Cause me to come"
---

*Cause me to come to your river, O Lord. (x3)*   
Cause me to come, cause me to drink, cause me to live.

*Speak Lord Your Word, I am listening to You. (x3)*   
Speak to my mind, speak to my will, speak to my heart.

*Feed me, O Lord, with Your body and blood. (x3)*   
Strengthen my mind, strengthen my will, strengthen my heart.
