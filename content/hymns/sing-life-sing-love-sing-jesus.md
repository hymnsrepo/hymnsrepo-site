**Sing Life, Sing Love, Sing Jesus   
Sing out whoever you are   
Sing Life, Sing Love, Sing Jesus   
Sing out whoever you are.**

Life is around us to use or abuse,   
Life in the great or the small   
Each one of us has the power to choose   
Whether to notice or just ignore life's call.

Love is around us to take and to give,   
Love bringing life to us all   
Each one of us in the way that we live   
Shows that we notice or just ignore love's call.

Jesus loved life, but for love Jesus died,   
Jesus, the truth and the way   
Though life was lost and the truth was denied,   
Love lives again as we greet the Lordâ€™s new day.
