title: "The cup of blessing that we raise"
---

**The cup of blessing that we raise,   
Is a communion with Christ's own blood.**

Tell me how can I repay the Lord   
For all the goodness He has shown to me   
I will life up the cup of salvation   
The name of God I will call.

O how precious in the sight of God   
The death of those so faithful and so true   
I'm your servant, the child of your handmaid   
Yes, you have loosened my bonds.

I will bring a sacrifice of praise   
And I will call upon the name of God   
Before all I'll fulfil my promise   
The vows I made to the Lord.
