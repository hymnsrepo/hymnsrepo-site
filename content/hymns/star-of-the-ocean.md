Star of the ocean and gateway to heaven,   
Guide of the pilgrim and light of our way,
Save us from danger and lead us onward:
Mary, we trust in your care.

**Ave, Ave, Ave Maria!   
Ave, Ave, hail Mary full of grace!**   

Show us, O Mary, that you are our Mother,   
Show to the rest of your offspring your Son,   
Who by His dying and rising healed us:   
Pouring new wine at your word.   

Guard us in danger, O blest among women,   
Keep us from sin on our journey through life;   
Till we reach harbour protect us, guide us:   
Mary, bright star in the night!
