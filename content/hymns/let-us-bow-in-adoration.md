title: "Let us bow in adoration"

Let us bow in adoration   
To this Sacrament so great   
Here is new and perfect worship   
All the old must terminate   
Senses can not grasp this marvel   
Faith must serve to compensate.

Glory, honor, adoration   
Let us sing in one accord   
Praised be God, Almighty Father,   
Praised be Christ, His Son, our Lord   
Praised be God, the Holy Spirit   
Triune Godhead be adored.   
Amen.
