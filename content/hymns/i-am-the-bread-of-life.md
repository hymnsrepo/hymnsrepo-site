title: "I am the bread of life"
---

I am the bread of life;   
Those who come to me shall not hunger,   
Those who believe in me shall not thirst.   
No one can come to me, unless the Father draw him.

***And I will raise them up (x3)***   
**On the last day!**

The bread that I will give   
Is my flesh for the life of the world.   
The one who eats of this bread,   
Shall live forever, shall live forever.

<!--Unless you eat of the flesh   
Of the Son of Man,   
And drink of his blood, and drink of his blood   
You shall not have life within you-->

I am the resurrection, I am the life;   
If you believe in me, even if you die,   
You shall live forever.

Yes, Lord I believe   
That you are the Christ,   
The Son of God who has come into the world.   
Has come into the world.
