We see Christ with eyes of the heart   
With our hands we touch the Word of Life   
What we see and hear we declare   
That together the life   
Of Father and Son we may share   

**For our Savior has conquered!   
_Alleluia! He has conquered!_   
Over death victorious!   
_Alleluia! Victorious!_   
Over evil He’ll triumph!   
_Alleluia! He’ll triumph!_   
Jesus reigns over all!**   

We have heard this message from Him   
God is light, before Him the darkness flees   
If we claim to share in His life   
We must walk in the light   
To banish all evil and strife!   

See what love God showed to us all   
We are called his children and so we are   
God is love, and love casts out fear   
We'll be like unto him   
For we'll see him when he appears
