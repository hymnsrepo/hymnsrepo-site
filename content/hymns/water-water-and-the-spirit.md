title: "Water, water and the Spirit"
---

Water, water and the Spirit,   
Promise, promise of a new life   
We are born of water and the Spirit,   
And life is ours, a life that will never end.

Waters, waters of creation;   
Symbol of regeneration,   
Sign that we were buried with Christ Jesus   
And that we walk in newness of life with him.

Waters of a new vocation;   
Calling us to proclamation,   
Urging us to share the life of Jesus,   
To spread his truth to all and to be the light.
