In bread we bring You Lord, our bodies' labour,   
In wine we offer You our spirits' grief.   
We do not ask You Lord: who is our neightbour?   
But stand united now, one in belief.
Oh we have gladly heard your Word, Your holy Word   
And now in answer, Lord, our gifts we bring.   
Our selfish hearts make true,   
Our failing faith renew,   
Our lives belong to You, our Lord and King.
