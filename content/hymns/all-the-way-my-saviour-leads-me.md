All the way my Saviour leads me   
Who have I to ask beside   
How could I doubt His tender mercy   
Who through life has been my guide

All the way my Saviour leads me   
Cheers each winding path I tread   
Gives me grace for every trial   
Feeds me with the Living Bread   

You lead me and keep me from falling   
You carry me close to Your heart   
And surely Your goodness and mercy   
Will follow me

All the way my Saviour leads me   
O the fullness of His love   
O the sureness of His promise   
In the triumph of His blood   

And when my Spirit clothed immortal   
Wings its flight to realms of day   
This my song through endless ages   
Jesus led me all the way   
Jesus led me all the way   

All the way my Saviour leads me   
All the way my Saviour leads me
