1. The angel Gabriel from heaven came   
His wings as drifted snow his eyes as flame   
"All hail" said he "thou lowly maiden Mary,   
_Most highly favored lady," Gloria!_

2. "For know a blessed mother thou shalt be,   
All generations laud and honor thee,   
Thy Son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold   
_Most highly favored lady," Gloria!_

3. Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head   
"To me be as it pleaseth God," she said,   
"My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name."   
_Most highly favored lady. Gloria!_

4. Of her, Emmanuel, the Christ was born   
In Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn   
And Christian folk throughout the world will ever say:   
_"Most highly favored lady," Gloria!_
