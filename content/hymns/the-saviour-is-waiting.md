title: "The Saviour is waiting"
---

The Saviour is waiting to enter your heart,   
Why don't you let Him come in?   
There's nothing in this world to keep you apart,   
What is your answer to Him?

**Time after time He has waited before,   
And now He is waiting again.   
To see if you're willing to open the door,   
Oh how He wants to come in.**

If you'll take one step towards the Saviour, my friend   
You'll find His arms open wide.   
Receive Him and all of your darkness will end,   
Within your heart, He'll abide.
