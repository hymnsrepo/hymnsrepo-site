Holy God we praise Thy name,   
Lord of all we bow before Thee;   
All on earth Thy sceptre claim,   
All in heaven above adore Thee;   
*Infinite Thy vast domain   
Everlasting is thy reign. (x2)*

Hark! the loud celestial hymn,   
Angel choirs above are raising;   
Cherubim and Seraphim   
In unceasing chorus praising;   
*Fill the heavens with sweet accord:   
Holy, holy, holy Lord. (x2)*

Holy Father, Holy Son   
Holy Spirit three we name Thee,   
While in essence only One,   
Undivided God we claim Thee:   
*And adoring bend the knee   
While we own the mystery. (x2)*
