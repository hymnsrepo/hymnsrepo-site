title: "Bread that was sown"
---

Bread that was sown in our hills and valleys,   
Now harvested, becomes one;   
From all the world gather Your people, O God,   
Into the feast of Your love.

With grateful hearts, we sing our joy for knowing   
The Spirit within, among us all,   
Life and knowledge, revealed through Your word:   
Jesus, the Christ, Emmanuel.

Leaven and wheat: so let us be for others,   
Nurturing good with earnest care,   
Bringing to birth new life where hope has gone stale,   
Faith giving moments to share.
