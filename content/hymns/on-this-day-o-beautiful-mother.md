**On this day, O beautiful Mother,   
On this day we give thee our love.   
Near thee, Madonna, fondly we hover,   
Trusting thy gentle care to prove.**   

1. On this day we ask to share,   
    Dearest Mother, thy sweet care;   
    Aid us ere our feet astray,   
    Wander from thy guiding way.
2. Queen of angels deign to hear   
    Lisping children's humble pray'r;
    Young hears gain, O virgin pure,   
    Sweetly to thyself allure.
3. Rose of Sharon, lovely flow'r,   
    Beauteous bud of Eden's bow'r;   
    Cherished lily of the vale,
    Virgin Mother, Queen we hail.
4. In vain the flow'rs of love we bring,
    In vain sweet music's note we sing,
    If contrite heart and lowly prayer,
    Guide not our gifts to thy bright sphere.
5. Fast our days of life we run,
    Soon the night of death will come;
    Tower of strength in that dread hour,
    Come with all thy gentle power.
