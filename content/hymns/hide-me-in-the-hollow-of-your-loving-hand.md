Hide me in the hollow of Your loving hand   
Where the foe may not pursue, nor the traitor stand   
There without anxiety or a trace of grief   
Calmed from every tension, I will find relief.

**Jesus is my refuge, Jesus is my Saviour,   
Jesus is my hiding place: Lord I trust in You.**

All the joy and sorrows strewn upon my path,   
Death - resurrection traced upon my heart,   
I will now accept because I live in You;   
And Your Spirit fills me, builds my life anew.

Flood my life with peace and Your serenity   
Like a silent pool I'll live in tranquility;   
So that I may flow to others every day,   
Like a river growing deeper all the way.
