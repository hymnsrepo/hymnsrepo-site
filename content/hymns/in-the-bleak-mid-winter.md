1. In the bleak mid-winter   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Frosty wind made moan,   
Earth stood hard as iron,   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Water like a stone;   
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Snow on snow,   
In the bleak mid-winter   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Long ago.

2. Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor earth sustain;   
Heaven and earth shall flee away   
&nbsp;&nbsp; When He comes to reign:   
In the bleak mid-winter   
&nbsp;&nbsp; A stable-place sufficed   
The Lord God Almighty,   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus Christ.

3. Enough for Him, whom Cherubim   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Worship night and day,   
A breastful of milk   
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a mangerful of hay;   
Enough for Him, whom angels   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fall down before,   
The ox and ass and camel   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which adore.

4. Angels and archangels   
&nbsp;&nbsp; May have gathered there,   
Cherubim and Seraphim   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thronged the air,   
But only His mother   
&nbsp;&nbsp; In her maiden bliss,   
Worshipped the Beloved   
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a kiss.

5. What can I give Him,   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor as I am?   
If I were a shepherd   
&nbsp;&nbsp; I would bring a lamb,   
If I were a wise man   
&nbsp;&nbsp; I would do my part,   
Yet what I can I give Him,   
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give my heart.
