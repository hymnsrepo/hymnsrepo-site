**Come, come, Emmanuel!  
Son of God, appear.  
Heaven and earth, rejoice!  
Salvation is drawing near.  
Salvation is drawing near.**

O come, O come, Emmanuel,  
And ransom captive Israel,  
That mourns in lonely exile here  
Until the Son of God appear.

O come, O Wisdom from on high,  
Who ordered all things mightily;  
To us the path of knowledge show,  
And teach us in her ways to go.

O come, O Rod of Jesse’s stem;  
From ev’ry foe deliver them  
That trust your mighty pow’r to save,  
And give them vict’ry o’er the grave.

O come, Desire of nations, bind  
In one the hearts of humankind;  
Make all our sad divisions cease,  
And be for us the King of Peace.

*After final refrain*   
Rejoice! Emmanuel  
shall come to thee, O Israel. (twice)
