title: A spotless Rose is blowing 
subtitle: 15th Century Traditional German

A spotless Rose is blowing   
Sprung from a tender root,   
Of ancient seers’ foreshowing,   
Of Jesse promised fruit;   
Its fairest bud unfolds to light   
Amid the cold, cold winter   
And in the dark midnight.

The Rose which I am singing,   
Whereof Isaiah said,   
Is from its sweet root springing   
In Mary, purest Maid;   
For through our God’s great love and might   
The blessed babe she bare us   
In a cold, cold winter’s night.
