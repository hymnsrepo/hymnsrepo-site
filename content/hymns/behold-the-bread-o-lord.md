**Behold the bread, O Lord, we offer unto you
O take our hearts as well and consecrate them too.**

1. Before you, loving Father, let our offering rise,
  The symbol of a pure and holy sacrifice.
1. O let us be your harvest, Harvester Divine,
  We offer you the sheaves, Lord, full of grain so fine.
1. O nurture all your grape vines, let their branches stretch
  That they may spread afar, Lord, over all the earth.
