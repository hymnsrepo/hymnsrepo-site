**Remember man: dust indeed you are
And it is to dust you shall return.**

1. Let us rend our hearts not our garments
   and return to the Lord our God
   For gracious and merciful is He!
1. Spare Your people O Lord
   Give heed to the cry of your priest
   Do not silence those who sing Your praises.
1. Let us mend our ways for the better
   and hasten the time of repentance
   For the day of the Lord is near!
1. Listen to our prayer have mercy
   On the people you claim for Your own
   The people who sinned against You
1. O God our Saviour help us
   Forgive us our sins O Lord
   For the sake of the glory of Your name!
1. Give glory to the Father almighty,
   To His Son Jesus Christ our Lord
   To the Spirit who dwells in our hearts.
