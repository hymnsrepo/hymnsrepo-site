**United in one body with Jesus Christ the Lord,
we bring to You our offering of bread and wine, O God.**

1. We are the wheat of Christ:
  If we be ground in the mill of life,
  May we be found pure bread.
1. We are the grape of Christ:
  If we be crushed in the wine-press of suffering,
  May we be found pure wine.
1. We are the Body of Christ:
  We must expect a share in His sorrow,
  If we must rise Him.
