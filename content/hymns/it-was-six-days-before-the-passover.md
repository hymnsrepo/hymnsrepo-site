It was six days before the Passover.   
Jesus entered Jerusalem   
And the children ran out waving branches   
As they sang to Him these words of praise.

**Come on and sing Hosanna,   
Sing Hosanna, sing hosanna in the highest.**

Lift your heads, O you gates, and reach higher   
Let him enter, the glorious King.   
Tell me, who is the King robed in glory?   
He's the mighty Lord of heaven's hosts.

Come on and blest is He, the King who comes,   
So rich in mercy and in love.   
Come on and blest is He, the King who comes,   
So rich in mercy and in love.
