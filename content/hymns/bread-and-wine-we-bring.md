1. Bread and wine we bring to you, Lord
  Work of our human hands,
  Soon to become your body and blood,
  Jesus yourself.
  May all who share this meal divine be one.
1. Humbly we bring ourselves to you, Lord,
  Take our hearts, take our wills,
  All that we have and all that we do,
  we give to you:
  All for you, our savior and our God.
