title: "Daily, daily sing to Mary"

Daily, daily sing to Mary,   
Sing, my soul, her praises due:   
All her feasts, her actions honour   
With the heart's devotion true.   
Lost in wond'ring contemplation,   
Be her majesty confessed:   
Call her Mother, call her Virgin,   
Happy Mother, Virgin blest.

She is mighty in her pleading,   
Tender in her loving care;   
Ever watchful, understanding,   
All our sorrows she will share.   
Advocate and loving mother,   
Mediatrix of all grace:   
Heaven's blessings she dispenses   
On our sinful human race.

Sing, my tongue, the Virgin's trophies   
Who for us her Maker bore.   
For the curse of old inflicted,   
Peace and blessing to restore.   
Sing in songs of peace unending,   
Sing the world's majestic Queen.   
Weary not nor faint in telling.   
All the gifts she gives to men.

All my senses, heart, affections,   
Strive to her glory forth;   
Spread abroad the sweet memorials,   
Of the Virgin's priceless worth;   
Where the voice of music thrilling,   
Where the tongues of eloquence,   
That can utter hymns beseeming   
All her matchless excellence?

All our graces flow through Mary;   
All then join her praise to sing:   
Fairest work of all creation,   
Mother of creation's King.   
Sing in songs of peace unending,   
Call upon her lovingly:   
Seat of wisdom, Gate of heaven,   
Morning star upon the sea.
