title: "Go, go into the world"
---

I tell you now, "Go proclaim"   
I give to you my Spirit's flame.   
He is at work, inside of You,   
To overcome all the powers of darkness.

**Go, go into the world tell them I'm alive   
Go into the streets, tell them that I live,   
Oh! that I live in you.   
Go, go into the world, claim it for your King,   
Go into the streets, dry your people's tears,   
Oh! making all things new.**

Be not afraid, speak my Word,   
You're not alone, I'm always there.   
Go tell the world, "Repent, believe!"   
The time is ripe and the kingdom is here.
