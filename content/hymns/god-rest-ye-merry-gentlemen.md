1. God rest you merry, gentlemen,   
Let nothing you dismay.   
For Jesus Christ our Savior,[^2]   
Was born on Christmas Day;[^3]   
To save us all from Satan’s power,   
When we were gone astray.

    _Chorus_   
    **O tidings of comfort and joy,   
    For Jesus Christ our Savior   
    Was born on Christmas day.**

    _Alternate chorus (from Bramley & Stainer)_   
    **O tidings of comfort and joy,   
    Comfort and joy;   
    O tidings of comfort and joy.**

2. In Bethlehem, in Jury,[^5]   
This blessed Babe was born,[^6]   
And laid within a manger,   
Upon this blessed morn;   
The which His mother Mary   
Did nothing take in scorn.[^7]   

3. From God our heavenly Father,   
A blessed angel came.   
And unto certain shepherds,   
Brought tidings of the same,   
How that in Bethlehem was born,   
The Son of God by name:   

4. Fear not, then said the Angel,   
Let nothing you affright,   
This day is born a Savior,   
Of virtue, power, and might;[^8]   
So frequently to vanquish all,   
The friends of Satan quite;[^9]   

5. The shepherds at those tidings,   
Rejoiced much in mind,   
And left their flocks a feeding,   
In tempest, storm, and wind,   
And went to Bethlehem straightway,   
This blessed babe to find:[^10]

6. But when to Bethlehem they came,   
Whereas this infant lay[^11]   
They found him in a manger,   
Where oxen feed on hay;   
His mother Mary kneeling,[^12]   
Unto the Lord did pray:

7. With sudden joy and gladness[^13]   
The shepherds were beguiled,   
To see the Babe if Israel,   
Before His mother mild,   
O then with joy and cheerfulness   
Rejoice, each mother's child.   

8. Now to the Lord sing praises,   
All you within this place,   
And with true love and brotherhood,   
Each other now embrace;   
This holy tide of Christmas,   
Doth bring redeeming grace.[^14]   

9. God bless the ruler of this house,   
And send him long to reign,   
And many a merry Christmas   
May live to see again;   
Among your friends and kindred   
That live both far and near.
