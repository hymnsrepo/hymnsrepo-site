**Humbly we come before your face, O Lord
Take the gifts we offer you!
Humbly we come before your face, O LOrd
Grant us peace and salvation.**

1. Blessed are you, Lord, God of all creation.
  Thanks to your goodness, here is bread,
  Bread which our hands have made and earth has given.
  It will become the Bread of life.
1. Blessed are you, Lord, God of all creation.
  Thanks to your goodness, here is wine,
  Fruit of the vine and work of human hands, O Lord.
  Wine to become your precious blood.
