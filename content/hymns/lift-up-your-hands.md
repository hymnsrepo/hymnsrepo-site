1. Lift up your hands and offer to the Lord.
  Lift up your hands and offer to your God.
  All that your life may hold of joy and care,
  Lift up your hands unto the Lord.
1. Lift up your eyes and see the works of God.
  Lift up your eyes to the glory of the Lord.
  See all the beauty he has spread for you:
  Lift up your eyes unto the Lord.
1. Lift up your heart unto the heart of God.
  Offer your love with his love to accord.
  Eager is he to have this gift from you;
  Lift up your heart unto the Lord.

**Lift up your hands and offer to the Lord
Lift up your hands and see the works of God.
Lift up your heart unto the heart of God,
Offer your love with his love to accord.**

1. Through your goodness, Lord, we bring
  gifts of bread and wine,
  which will soon become for us
  life-giving food and drink.
1. Take this drop of water too:
  our humanity.
  By its mingling make us share
  in your divinity
1. Lord, we ask you, pleas accept
  this, our sacrifice.
  Sinners all, we bring to you
  humble and contrite hearts.
