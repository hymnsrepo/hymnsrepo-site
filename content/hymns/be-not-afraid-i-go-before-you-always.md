title: "Be not afraid! I go before you always"
---

**Be not afraid! I go before you always   
Come, follow me and I will give you rest.**

You shall cross the barren desert,   
But you shall not die of thirst.   
You shall wander far in safety   
Though you do not know the way.   
You shall speak your words in foreign lands   
And they will understand.   
You shall see the face of God and live.

If you pass through raging waters   
In the sea you shall not drown.   
If you walk amid the burning flames,   
You shall not be harmed.   
If you stand before the pow'r of hell   
And death is at your side,   
Know that I am with you through it all!

Blessed are the poor,   
For the kingdom shall be theirs.   
Blest are you that weep and mourn,   
For one day you shall laugh.    
And if wicked ones insult   
And hate you all because of me,   
Blessed, blessed are you!
