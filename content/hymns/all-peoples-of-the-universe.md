All peoples of the universe,   
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice,   
Him loudly praise and gladly serve,   
Into His presence, come with songs.

Know that the Lord is God indeed!   
He made us, we belong to Him;   
We, all on earth, his people are,   
The flock he tends, the sheep we are.

O enter then his gates with praise,   
These courts of his approach with joy,   
Give thanks to him who reigns on high,   
And bless his ever holy name.

The Lord is gracious, He is good;   
Eternal is His love for us.   
His mercy lasts from age to age.   
His faithfulness has never failed.

To God the Father glory be,   
To Jesus Christ, his Son, Our Lord   
And to the Spirit, source of love,   
Give praise both now and evermore
