title: "A new commandment"

**A new commandment I give unto you   
That you love one another as I have loved you (x2)**

By this shall all know that you are my disciples:   
If you have love for one another (x2)

You are my friends if you do what I command you   
Without my help you can do nothing (x2)

I am the true Vine, my Father is the gard'ner   
Abide in me and I in you (x2)

You are my friends now, no longer are you servants
I chose you all - you did not choose me.

True love is patient, not arrogant nor boastful;   
love bears all things, love is eternal (x2)
