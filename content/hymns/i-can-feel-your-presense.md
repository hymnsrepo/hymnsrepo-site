title: I can feel your presence
---

**I can feel your presence in my life.
I know you are always near
You understand me more than I could ever know
I can feel your presence in my life.**

1. You go before me, yet you always lead me on.
  You guide me with your gentle hand;
  You know my movements, when I sit and when I stand,
  I know you are always near.

1. Were I to journey to the highest mountain top,
  Sail to the limits of the sea;
  I never would escape your presence and your love,
  I know you are always near.

1. You knew my being when I was not yet conceived,
  You formed me in my mother's womb;
  And now I thank you for the love you gave to me,
  I know you are always near.

1. Probe me and know me, Lord, my actions and my thoughts,
  And try my mind to know its fears;
  Lord purify my heart according to your ways,
  I know you are always near.
