### NICENO - CONSTANTINOPOLITAN CREED

I believe in one God, the Father almighty   
maker of heaven and earth,   
of all things visible and invisible.   
I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,   
the Only Begotten Son of God,   
born of the Father before all ages.   
God from God, Light from Light,   
true God from true God,   
begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father,   
through him all things were made.   
For us men and for our salvation   
he came down from heaven, (all bow)   
and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,   
and became man.   
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,   
he suffered death and was buried,   
and rose again on the third day   
in accordance with the Scriptures.   
He ascended into heaven   
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.   
He will come again in glory   
to judge the living and the dead   
and his kingdom will have no end.   
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord the giver of life,   
who proceeds from the Father and the Son,   
who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,   
who has spoken through the prophets.   
I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.   
I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins   
and I look forward to the ressurection of the dead   
and the life of the world to come. Amen.

### THE APOSTLES CREED

I believe in God the Father almighty,   
Creator of heaven and earth,   
and in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord, (all bow)   
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,   
born of the Virgin Mary,   
suffered under Pontius Pilate,   
was crucified, died and was buried:   
he descended into hell;   
on the third day he rose again from the dead,   
he ascended into heaven,   
and is seated at the right hand of God   
the Father almighty,   
from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.   
I believe in the Holy Spirit,   
the holy catholic Church,   
the communion of saints,   
the forgiveness of sins,   
the resurrection of the body,   
and life everlasting, Amen.

<hr/>

### THE LITURGY OF THE EUCHARIST

> During the Offertory Song the faithful bring forward bread and wine for the celebration of the Eucharist. The Priest offers prayers of blessing:

C. Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the bread we offer you:   
fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for us the bread of life.   
P. Blessed be God for ever.

C. Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the wine we offer you:   
fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual drink.   
P. Blessed be God for ever.

> The Priest completes additional personal preparatory rites, all stand:

C. Pray, brethren (brothers and sisters),   
that my sacrifice and yours   
may be acceptable to God,   
the almighty Father.

for our good   
and the good of all his holy Church.

thy kingdom come   
thy will be done   
on earth as it is in heaven.   
Give us this day our daily bread,   
and forgive us our trespasses,   
as we forgive those who trespass   
against us;   
and lead us not into temptation,   
but deliver us from evil.   
C. Deliver us, Lord we pray, from every evil,   
graciously grant peace in our days,   
that, by the help of your mercy,   
we may be always free from sin   
and safe from distress,   
as we await the blessed hope   
and the coming of our saviour, Jesus Christ.   
P. For the kingdom,   
the power and the glory are yours   
now and for ever.

C. Lord Jesus Christ,   
who said to your Apostles:   
Peace I leave you, my peace I give you;   
look not on our sins,   
but on the faith of your Church,   
and graciously grant her peace and unity   
in accordance with your will.   
Who live and reign for ever and ever.
