**In the Lord, is my hope,   
In the Lord, is my help.   
He's my shield and my strength.   
He's my fortress: I stand firm.**

I've no fear of the night and its shadow,   
I've no fear of the plague that prowls around,   
For Your light shines, O Lord, in the darkness,   
And Your brightness, leads me on.

I've no fear if alone I'll be walking,   
I've no fear if the journey is so long,   
For it's You, Lord, the way to the Father,   
On Your path, I am safe.

I've no fear of the death that surrounds me,   
I've no fear in a world of woes and ills,   
For I know, Lord, You grant life eternal   
If I only hope in You.

I've no fear if assailed by disaster,   
I've no fear in the midst of pain and gloom,   
For You are, Lord, my joy my salvation.   
Alleluia! Praise the Lord!
