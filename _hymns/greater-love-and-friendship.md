title: "Greater love and friendship"
---

Greater love and friendship has no man than this   
That he die for others, give his life for all.   
No more are you servants, I have called you friends,   
All my Father told me, I made known to you.

**Without You I am nothing.   
My weakness needs Your strength.   
So speak, Lord, to Your servant.   
I'm waiting for You Word!**

Go and build my kingdom, pluck up and break down.   
Speak what I command you, I shall be with you.   
No, you did not choose me, I appointed you,   
Go, bear fruit in plenty, fruit that should abide.

Have you seen my people, have you heard their cry?   
Do you know their suffering? Can you let them die?   
Break the unjust fetter, set the captive free.   
Share break with the hungry, make the blind to see.
