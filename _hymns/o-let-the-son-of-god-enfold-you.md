title: "O let the Son of God enfold you"
---

O let the Son of God enfold you with his spirit and his love,  
Let him fill your heart and satisfy your soul.  
O let him have the things that hold you, and his Spirit, like a dove,  
Will descend upon your life and make you whole.  

**Jesus, we thank you for your word of truth,  
Jesus, we thank you for the bread of life.**  

O come and sing this song with gladness, as your hearts are filled with joy.  
Lift your hands in brave surrender to his name.   
O give him all your tears and sadness, give him all your years of pain,  
And you'll enter into life in Jesus' name.
