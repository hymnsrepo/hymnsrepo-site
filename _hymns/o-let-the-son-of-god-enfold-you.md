title: "O let the Son of God enfold you"
---

O let the Son of God enfold you with His Spirit and His love,  
Let Him fill your heart and satisfy your soul.  
O let Him have the things that hold you, and His Spirit, like a dove,  
Will descend upon your life and make you whole.  

**Jesus, we thank you for Your Word of Truth,  
Jesus, we thank you for the Bread of Life.**  

O come and sing this song with gladness, as your hearts are filled with joy.  
Lift your hands in brave surrender to His name.   
O give Him all your tears and sadness, give Him all your years of pain,  
And you'll enter into life in Jesus' name.
