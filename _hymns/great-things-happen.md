**Great things happen when God mixes with us (x2)   
Great and beautiful, wonderful things,   
Great things happen when God mixes with us.**

Some find life, some find peace; some people also find joy.   
Some see things as they never could before   
And some people find that they can now begin to trust.

Some find health, some find hope; some people even find joy.   
Some see themselves as they never could before   
And some people find that they can now begin to live.

Some find peace, some are disturbed; some people even find joy.   
Some see their lives as they never could before   
And some people find that they must now begin to change.
