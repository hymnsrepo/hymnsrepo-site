title: In bread we bring You Lord

In bread we bring You Lord,   
Our bodies labour,   
In wine we offer You   
Our spirit's grief.   
We do not ask You Lord:   
Who is our neightbour?   
But stand united now,   
One in belief.

Oh we have gladly heard:   
Your Word Your holy Word   
And now in answer, Lord,   
Our gifts we bring.   
Our selfish hearts make true,   
Our failing faith renew,   
Our lives belong to You,   
Our Lord and King.
