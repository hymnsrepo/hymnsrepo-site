Once in royal David's city,   
Stood a lowly cattle shed,   
Where a mother laid her Baby,   
In a manger for His bed:   
Mary was that mother mild,   
Jesus Christ, her little Child.   

He came down to earth from heaven,   
Who is God and Lord of all,   
And His shelter was a stable,   
And His cradle was a stall:   
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,   
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.

For He is our childhood's pattern;   
Day by day, like us, He grew;   
He was little, weak, and helpless,   
Tears and smiles, like us He knew;   
And He cares when we are sad,   
And he shares when we are glad.

And our eyes at last shall see Him,   
Through His own redeeming love;   
For that Child so dear and gentle,   
Is our Lord in heaven above:   
And He leads His children on,   
To the place where He is gone.
