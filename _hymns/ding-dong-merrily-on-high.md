Ding Dong! merrily on high   
In heav'n the bells are ringing   
Ding, dong! verily the sky   
Is riv'n with angel singing   
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!

E'en so here below, below   
Let steeple bells be swungen   
And i-o, i-o, i-o   
By priest and people be sungen   
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis.

Pray ye dutifully prime   
Your matin chime, ye ringers   
May ye beautifully rime   
Your evetime song, ye singers   
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
