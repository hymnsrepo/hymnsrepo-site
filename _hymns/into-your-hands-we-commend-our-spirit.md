**Into Your hands we commend our spirit O Lord,   
Into Your hands we commend our hearts.   
For we must die to ourselves in loving You,   
Into Your hands we commend our love.**

O God, my God, why have You gone from me,   
Far from my prayers, far from my cry?   
To You I call and you never answer me,   
You send no comfort and I don't know why!

You've been my guide since I was very yound,   
You showed the way, you brought relief;   
But now I'm lonely, nobody's by my side:   
Take heed, my Lord, listen to my prayer.
