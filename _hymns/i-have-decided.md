I have decided to follow Jesus (x3)   
*No turning back, no turning back.*

The world behind me, the cross before me (x3)   
*No turning back, no turning back.*

I will take nothing, no bread or money (x3)   
*No turning back, no turning back.*

And when I see thee, so poor and hungry (x3)   
*No turning back, no turning back.*

And should my road seem too long and weary (x3)   
*No turning back, no turning back.*

I know that Mary will guide my footsteps (x3)   
*No turning back, no turning back.*
