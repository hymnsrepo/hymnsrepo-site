title: Make me an instrument
subtitle: St. Francis of Assisi
---

Make me an instrument of your peace:   
Where there is hatred, let me bring love.   
Where there is injury, Your pardon, Lord,   
And where there's doubt, true faith in You.

Make me an instrument of Your peace:   
Where there's discouragement, let me bring hope.   
Where there is darkness, let me bring your light,   
And where there's sadness, let me bring joy.

Make me an instrument of your peace:   
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,   
It is in giving that we do receive,   
And it's in dying, that we're born to life.
