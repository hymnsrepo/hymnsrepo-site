title: "Lose yourself in me"
---

**Lose yourself in me and you will find yourself   
Lose yourself in me and you will find new life   
Lose yourself in me and you will find yourself   
And you will live, yes you will live in my heart.**

Unless a grain of wheat, falls into the ground   
It still remains but a grain of wheat   
But if it falls and dies, then it bears much fruit   
So it is with those who lose themselves in me.

Though foxes have their holes, birds a little nest   
The Son of man, no place to rest   
Whoever loves his life or strives the world to gain   
Will only find that life was lived in vain.

If we have died with Him, we shall live with Him   
If we endure, we'll reign with Him   
Though faithless we may be, faithfull He'll remain   
For how can Christ be false unto Himself?
