title: "Above All"
---

Above all powers above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things   
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man    
You were before the world began    

Above all kingdoms above all thrones    
Above all wonders this world has ever known     
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth    
There's no way to measure what you're worth    

**Crucified, laid behind a stone     
You lived to die, rejected and alone     
Like a rose, trampled on the ground     
You took the fall and thought of me     
Above All**
