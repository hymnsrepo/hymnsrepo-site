Just to fix our eyes on Jesus   
Who has fought the good fight to the end;   
And to be the grain that's fallen   
To the ground to die and rise again.

**This is my sacrifice, an open ear I bring   
Here, Lord, I come to do your will,   
Here, Lord, I come to do your will.**

Just to follow in his footsteps   
And to live according to his ways.   
Oh! to be the salt to savour;   
And the light in darkness all my days.

Just to be like Christ, the sower,   
Planting seed that bears a hundredfold,   
Oh! to be the Word Incarnate,   
Letting life speak out with words untold.

Just to be the bread unleavened,   
Breathing out sincerity and truth,   
And to be the cup of blessing,   
Praising God upon a ten-string lute.
