title: My heart's like a flute

**My heart's like a flute and I want to play all day   
Jesus Christ is my music master.   
Deep from my heart flows a simple melody:   
Great is His love, love without end!   
Great is His love, love without end!**

Once I met the Lord on the way:   
Deep was His gaze, kind was His smile,   
True were His words, gentle His touch,   
He brought me peace and freedom.
