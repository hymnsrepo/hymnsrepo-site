**Comfort, comfort my people, says the Lord your God.   
Cry out loud to Jerusalem: God has pardoned you.**

1. Every valley shall be filled   
   Every mount and hill made low.
2. In the desert, make a path   
   For the Lord, Emmanuel.
3. For the glory of the Lord   
   Soon shall be revealed to me.
