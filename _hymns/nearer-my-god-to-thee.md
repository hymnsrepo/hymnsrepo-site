title: Nearer My God to thee
subtitle: Sarah & Eliza Adams
---

Nearer my God to thee, nearer to thee,   
Even though it be a cross that raiseth me.   
Still all my song shall: nearer my God to thee.   
Nearer my God to thee, nearer to thee.

Deep in Thy Sacred Heart, let me abide,   
Thou who hast bled for me, sorrowed and died.   
Sweet shall my weeping be, grief surely leading me,   
Nearer my God to thee, nearer to thee.
