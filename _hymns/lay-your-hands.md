**Lay Your hands gently upon us   
Let their touch render Your peace   
Let them bring Your forgiveness and healing.   
Lay Your hands, gently lay Your hands.**

You were sent to free the broken-hearted   
You were sent to give sight to the blind.   
You desire to heal all our illnesses,   
Lay Your hands, gently lay Your hands.

Lord, we come to You through one another.   
Lord, we come to You in our need.   
Lord, we come to You seeking wholeness.   
Lay Your hands, gently lay Your hands.
