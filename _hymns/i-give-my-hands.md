title: "I give my hands"
---

I give my hands to do Your work   
And, Jesus Lord, I give them willingly.   
I give my feet to go Your way   
And every step I shall take cheerfully.

**O the joy of the Lord is my strength, my strength,   
O the joy of the Lord is my help, my help.   
For the power of His Spirit is in my heart,   
And the joy of the Lord is my strength.**

I give my eyes to see the world   
And everyone in just the way You do.   
I give my tongue to speak Your words   
To spread Your name and freedom giving truth.

I give my mind in every way   
So that each thought I have will come from You.   
I give my Spirit to You, Lord,   
And every day my prayer will spring anew.

I give my heart that You may love   
In me Your Father and the human race.   
I give myself that You may grow   
In me and make my life a song of praise.
