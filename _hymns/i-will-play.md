title: "I will play before the Lord"
---

I will play before the Lord,   
I will sing to Him my melody,   
Stand among His people here,   
Telling of all His ways

Let us sing before the Lord;   
Let us sing to Him our melody,   
Stand within His temple here,   
Telling of all His ways.

**Sing, people of God, bless his holy name.   
Offering him our joyful hearts,   
Joining in endless praise.   
Alleluia, alleluia   
Alleluia, alleluia   
Joining in endless praise.**
