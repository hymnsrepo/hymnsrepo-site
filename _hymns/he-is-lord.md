**He is Lord, He is Lord,   
He is risen from the dead and He is Lord.   
Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess   
That Jesus Christ is Lord.**

Have this mind among yourselves, the mind of Jesus,   
Even though he was eternally God's Son   
He emptied himself to be the servant of all,   
He was humble and obedient unto death.

He is seated at the right hand of the Father.   
God put everything he made under his feet.   
He has given to Him the highest name that can be named   
And in all believing hearts He reigns supreme.

May your inward eye, your vision be illumined.   
May you know what is the hope that waits for you.   
For the glory God offers you as your inheritance   
Was displayed when He raised Jesus from the dead.
