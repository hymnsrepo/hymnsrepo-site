1. This is the truth sent from above,   
   The truth of God, the God of love;   
   Therefore don’t turn me from your door,   
   But hearken all, both rich and poor.

2. The first thing, which I do relate,   
   That God at first did man create   
   The next thing, which to you I tell,   
   Woman was made with him to dwell.

3. Then after this, ‘twas God’s own choice   
   To place them both in Paradise,   
   There to remain from evil free   
   Except they ate of such a tree.

4. But they did eat, which was a sin,   
   And thus their ruin did begin;   
   Ruined themselves, both you and me,   
   And all of their posterity.

5. Thus we were heirs to endless woes,   
   Till God the Lord did interpose   
   For so a promise soon did run   
   That He’d redeem us with a Son.   

6. And at this season of the year   
   Our blest Redeemer did appear   
   He here did live, and here did preach,   
   And many thousands He did teach.

7. Thus He in love to us behaved,   
   To show us how we must be saved   
   And if you want to know the way   
   Be pleased to hear what He did say.

8. Go preach the Gospel new, He said,   
   To all the nations that are made   
   And he that does believe in me,   
   From all his sins I’ll set him free.

9. God grant to all within this place   
   True saving faith—that special grace,   
   Which to His people doth belong—   
   And thus I close my Christmas song.
