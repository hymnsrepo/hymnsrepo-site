title: "Glory and praise"

**Glory and praise to our God;   
Who alone gives light to our days;   
Many are the blessings He bears   
To those who trust in his ways.**

We, the daughters and sons of Him,   
Who built the valleys and plains,   
Praise the wonders our God has done   
In every heart that sings.

In His wisdom He strengthens us,   
Like gold that's tested in fire.   
Though the power of sin prevails,   
Our God is there to save.

Every moment of every day,   
Our God is waiting to save,   
Always ready to seek the lost,   
To answer those who pray.
