Give thanks with a grateful heart   
Give thanks to the Holy One.   
Give thanks because He's given   
Jesus Christ, His Son.

And now let the weak say, "I am strong",   
Let the poor say, "I am rich",   
Because of what the Lord has done for us.   
And now let the weak say, "I am strong",   
Let the poor say, "I am rich",   
Because of what the Lord has done for us,   
Give thanks.
