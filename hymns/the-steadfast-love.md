title: "The steadfast love"
---

**The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.   
His mercies never come to an end.   
They are new every morning, new every morning,   
Great is Your faithfulness, O Lord,   
Great is Your faithfulness.**

The Lord is good to those who wait for Him,   
To the soul that seeks Him.   
It is good that we should wait quietly   
For the salvation of the Lord.

Let us test and examine all our ways,   
And return unto the Lord,   
Let us lift our hearts and not our hands alone   
Unto the Lord who is in heaven.

To trample underfoot a prisoner,   
To deny a human right,   
To employ injustice in a court of law:   
Such things the Lord does not approve.
