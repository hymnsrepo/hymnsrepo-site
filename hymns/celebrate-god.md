Celebrate God with your hands.   
Celebrate God with your voice.   
Celebrate God in all that you do   
And He will be with you.

Listen to Him with your eyes.   
Listen to Him with your heart.   
Listen to Him as He speaks with you,   
And He will be with you.

Touch Him in all those you love.   
Touch him in all those you love.   
Touch Him in them and let them touch you   
And He will be with you.

Celebrate God with us.   
Celebrate God with us.   
Emmanuel, Emmanuel.   
Celebrate God with us.
