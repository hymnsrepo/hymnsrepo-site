title: "We want to give You thanks, Lord"
---

We want to give You thanks, Lord,   
We want to give You praise,   
We want to open up our hearts,   
And let Your Spirit in.

**We want to see Your glory,   
We want to feel Your love,   
We want to show the world around us   
We're the family of God.**

We want to hear Your voice Lord,   
We want to know Your way,   
We need Your power in our lives,   
A lost world to win.
