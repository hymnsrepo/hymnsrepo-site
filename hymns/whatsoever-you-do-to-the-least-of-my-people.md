title: "Whatsoever you do"
---

**Whatsoever you do to the least of my people   
That you do unto me.**

*OR*

**Whatsover you do to the least of my brothers   
That you do unto me.   
Whatsoever you do to the least of my sisters   
That you do unto me.**

When I was hungry, you gave me to eat;   
When I was thirsty you gave me to drink.   
Now enter into the home of my Father.

When I was weary, you helped me find rest;   
When I was anxious, you calmed all my fears.   
Now enter into the home of my Father.

When I was homeless, you opened your door;   
When I was naked, you gave me your coat.   
Now enter into the home of my Father.

When in a prison, you came to my cell;   
When on a sickbed, you cared for my needs.   
Now enter into the home of my Father.

When I was laughed at, you stood by my side;   
When I was happy, you shared in my joy.   
Now enter into the home of my Father.
