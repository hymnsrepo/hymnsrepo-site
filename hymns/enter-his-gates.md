Enter His gates with thanksgiving in your hearts   
Enter His courts with praise.   
Enter His gates with thanksgiving in Your hearts   
For He has made me glad.

**He has made me glad, He has made me glad.   
Jesus has made me glad.   
Enter His courts with thanksgiving in your hearts.   
For He has made me glad.**

Sing to the Lord and make music unto Him.   
Sing to the Lord with joy.   
Sing to the Lord and make music unto Him,   
For He has made me glad.

Worship, bend low, while proclaiming He is God,   
Praise to the Lord Most High.   
Worship, bend low, while proclaiming He is God,   
For He has made me glad.
