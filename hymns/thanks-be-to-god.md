title: "Thanks be to God"

**Thanks be to God, thanks be to God   
For in union with Christ we are led to victory,   
Thanks be to God, Thanks be to God,   
Thanks be to God!**

We are Christ's fragrance   
That goes everywhere to save,   
The incense that burns to bring new life.

We bear His message,   
Not as peddlers of God's Word,   
But armed with sincerity and truth.

We are Christ's letter   
Written on the human heart,   
Inscribed by the Spirit of the Lord.
