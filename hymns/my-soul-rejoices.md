**My soul rejoices, my soul rejoices in my God.  
My soul rejoices, my soul rejoices in my God.**

My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord;   
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;  
he has looked upon his lowly servant  
and all generations will call me blessed.  

The Almighty has done great things for me  
and holy is his name.  
He has mercy on those who fear him,   
those in ev’ry generation.
