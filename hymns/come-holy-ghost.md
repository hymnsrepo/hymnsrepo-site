title: "Come Holy Ghost"

Come Holy Ghost, creator blest   
And in our souls take up Thy rest;   
Come with Thy grace and heavenly aid   
To fill the hearts which Thou hast made.

Great Paraclete, to Thee we cry,   
O greatest Gift of God Most High;   
O Fount of life, O fire of love   
And sweet anointing from above.
