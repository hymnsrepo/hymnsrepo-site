title: "Hail, holy Joseph hail!"
---

Hail! Holy Joseph, hail!   
Chaste spouse of Mary, hail!   
Pure as the lily flow'r   
In Eden's peaceful vale.

**Holy Joseph pray thou for us   
Holy Joseph pray thou for us (x2)**

Hail! Holy Joseph, hail!   
God's choice wert thou alone!   
To thee the Word made flesh   
Was subject as a son.

Hail! Holy Joseph, hail!   
Prince of the house of God!   
May His best graces be   
By thy sweet hands bestowed.

Hail! Holy Joseph, hail!   
Help of the needy, hail!   
Cheer thou the hearts that faint   
And guide the steps that fail.

Hail! Holy Joseph, hail!   
Teach us our flesh to tame;   
And, Mary, keep the hearts,   
That love thy husband's name

Mother of Jesus, bless,   
And bless, ye saints on high   
All meek and simple souls   
That to Saint Joseph cry.
