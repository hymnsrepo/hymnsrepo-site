title: "Mother of God, plead with your Son"

**Mother of God, plead with your Son,   
Pray for us sinners, Mary most pure.**

May God pour cleansing streams over us,   
Washing our souls from every stain.

May He remove our stony hearts,   
Give us a heart of flesh in its stead.

May He incline our minds to His voice,   
That we may bend our hearts to His will.

May He renew the strength of the weak   
And be the hope of wavering wills.

That He may wipe away every tear   
And make His light to shine on our face.
