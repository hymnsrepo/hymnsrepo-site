title: "Blest are they"
---

Blest are they, the poor in spirit   
Theirs is the kingdom of God.   
Blest are they, full of sorrow   
They shall be consoled.   

**Rejoice, and be glad!   
Blessed are you, holy are you!   
Rejoice, and be glad!   
Yours is the Kingdom of God!**

Blest are they, the lowly ones   
They shall inherit the earth.   
Blest are they, who hunger and thirst   
They shall have their fill.

Blest are they, who show mercy   
Mercy shall be theirs.   
Blest are they, the pure of heart   
They shall see God.

Blest are they, who seek peace   
They are the children of God.   
Blest are they, who suffer in faith   
The glory of God is theirs.

Blest are you, who suffer hate   
All because of Me.   
Rejoice and be glad, yours is the kingdom   
Shine for all to see.
