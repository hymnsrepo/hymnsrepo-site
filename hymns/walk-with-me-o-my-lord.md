title: "Walk with me O my Lord"
---

**Walk with me O my Lord  
Through the darkest night and brightest day   
Be at my side O Lord   
Hold my hand and guide me on my way.**

Sometimes the road seems long, my energy is spent,   
Then Lord, I think of You and I am given strength.

Stones often bar my path and there are times I fall,   
But you are always there to help me when I call.

Just as you calmed the wind and walked upon the sea,   
Conquer, my living Lord, the storms that threaten me.
