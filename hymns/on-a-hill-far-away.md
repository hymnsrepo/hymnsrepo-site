title: "On a hill far away"
---

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross   
The emblem of suffering and shame.   
And I love that old cross, where the dearest and blest   
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

**So I'll cherish the old rugged cross   
Till my trophies at last I'll lay down   
I will cling to the old rugged cross   
And exchange it some day for a crown.**

O that old rugged cross so despised by the world   
Has a wondrous attraction for me   
For the dear Lamb of God, left His glory above   
To bear it to dark calvary.

In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine   
A wondrous beauty I see.   
For it was on that old cross, Jesus suffered and died,   
To pardon and sanctify me.
