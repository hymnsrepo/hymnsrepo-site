title: "I will sing of the mercies"
---

**I will sing of the mercies of the Lord   
Forever I will sing, I will sing,   
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord, forever   
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord**

With my mouth will I make known,   
Thy faithfulness, thy faithfulness,   
With my mouth will I make known   
Thy faithfulness to all generations.

I have found David my servant,   
And with my oil anointed Him,   
My arm shall make Him strong,   
My hand shall be with Him for generations.

I will make with him forever,   
My covenant, my convenant.   
He will say, "You are my Father,   
My God, my rock my fortress who saves me."
