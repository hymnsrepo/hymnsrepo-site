title: "Deep calls to deep"
---

Deep calls to deep   
My spirit finds no resting place, but Him.   
He is my God,   
The yearnings of my heart His touch can still.

**And each rare moment   
That I've felt His presence   
I shall remember   
And forever cherish**

Deep calls to deep,   
And at His feet I am a welcome guest:   
He gives me food,   
The hunger of my soul is laid to rest.

Deep calls to deep   
For he created me to be His own   
He understands   
The joy and pain of life, He too has known.
