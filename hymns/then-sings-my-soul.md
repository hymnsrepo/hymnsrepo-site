title: "Then sings my soul"
---

Oh Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder,   
Consider all the worlds thy hands have made   
I see the stars; I hear the rolling thunder,   
Thy power throughout the universe displayed:

**Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to thee:   
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!**

And when I think, that God His Son not sparing   
Sent Him to earth, I scarcely can believe,   
That on the cross, our burden gladly bearing,   
He gave His life for all the world's relief.

And when draws near the day of my salvation,   
What happiness, what joy shall fill my heart!   
When I shall bow in humble adoration,   
And then proclaim: my God, how great Thou art!
