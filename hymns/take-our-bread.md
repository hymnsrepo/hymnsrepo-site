title: "Take our bread"

**Take our bread, we ask you, take our hearts,   
We love You, take our lives,   
O Father we are Yours, we are Yours.**

Yours as we stand at the table You set,   
Yours as we eat the bread our hearts can't forget.   
We are the signs of your life with us yet:   
We are Yours, we are Yours.

Your holy people stand washed in Your blood,   
Spirit filled, yet hungry we await Your food,   
Poor though we are we have brought ourselves to You:   
We are Yours, we are Yours.
