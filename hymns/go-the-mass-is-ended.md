title: "Go the mass is ended"
---

Go the mass is ended, children of the Lord.   
Take His Word to others, as you've heard it spoken to you.   
Go the mass is ended, go and tell the world:   
"The Lord is good, the Lord is kind and He loves everyone".

Go the Mass is ended, take His love to all,   
Gladden those who meet you, fill their heartswith hope and courage.   
Go the mass is ended, fill the world with love,   
And give to all what you have received, the peace and joy of Christ.
