title: "Away in a manager"
---

Away in a manager; no crib for His bed   
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head   
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay   
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes   
But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes   
I love thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky   
And stay by my side 'til morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay   
Close by me forever And love me I pray   
Bless all the dear children in They tender care   
And take us to heaven to live with Thee there.
