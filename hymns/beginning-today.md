title: "Beginning today"
---

**Beginning today my mornings are Yours,   
The hopes that dawn in their light.   
Beginning today my evenings and dreams:   
My gift to you is my life.**

I will always remember the time You first called me   
Out of my empty sleep   
To waken in me the hope of a new day:   
The love I wanted to seek.

You gave me your life Lord, as sign of the springtime   
Beginning in me each day.   
You made me a person with wonder and love, Lord,   
To newly discover your way.

I promise this day I will sing for the world,   
The song we begin to share.   
To fill up tomorrow with sounds of our love, Lord   
The hopes and dreams that we bear.
