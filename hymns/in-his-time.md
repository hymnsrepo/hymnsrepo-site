title: "In His time"
---

In His time, in His time,   
He makes all things beautiful in His time.   
Lord, please show me everyday   
As You're teaching me Your way,   
That you do just what You say in Your time.

In Your time, in Your time,   
You make all things beautiful in Your time.   
Lord, my life to You I bring,   
With its winter and its spring,   
May I fathom everything in Your time.

There's a time, there's a time   
Both for sowing and for reaping there's a time.   
Time for losing, time for gain,   
Time for joy and time for pain,   
Every purpose under heaven has a time.

There are times, there are days,   
Weeks and months we cannot understand God's ways.   
If for years we fail to scan   
What is his eternal plan,   
We'll remember that He can, all the time.
