Sing, my tongue, the Saviour's glory,   
of His flesh the mystery sing;   
of the Blood, all price exceeding,   
shed by our immortal King,   
destined, for the world's redemption,   
from a noble womb to spring.

Of a pure and spotless Virgin   
born for us on earth below,   
He, as Man, with man conversing,   
stayed, the seeds of truth to sow;   
then He closed in solemn order   
wondrously His life of woe.   

On the night of that Last Supper,   
seated with His chosen band,   
He the Pascal victim eating,   
first fulfills the Law's command;   
then as Food to His Apostles   
gives Himself with His own hand.   

Word-made-Flesh, the bread of nature   
by His word to Flesh He turns;   
wine into His Blood He changes;   
what though sense no change discerns?   
Only be the heart in earnest,   
faith her lesson quickly learns.   

Down in adoration falling,   
This great Sacrament we hail,   
Over ancient forms of worship   
Newer rites of grace prevail;   
Faith will tell us Christ is present,   
When our human senses fail.

To the everlasting Father,   
And the Son who made us free   
And the Spirit, God proceeding   
From them Each eternally,   
Be salvation, honor, blessing,   
Might and endless majesty.   
Amen.
