title: "All that I am"

**All that I am, all that I do,   
All that I'll ever have I offer now to You.   
All that I'll dream, all that I pray,   
All that I'll ever make, I give to You today.**

Take and sanctify these gifts for Your honour, Lord,   
Knowing that I love and serve you is enough reward.
